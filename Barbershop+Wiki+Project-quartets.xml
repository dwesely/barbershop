== Extended History ==
'''Boston Common'''

Formed, quite literally by chance, at a mutual friend's home in 1971, The Boston Common (Kent Martin, tenor; Rich Knapp, lead; Larry Tully, bari and Terry Clarke, bass) remained active through the mid 1990s, performing in 46 states and five foreign countries, on network radio and television shows (including NBC's Today Show, the CBS AM AMERICA, Irish television, BBC-TV, Germany's WDR, and Canada's CBC-TV) and a host of regional radio and television programs. 

In addition, the group was featured by UPI and numerous magazines and newspapers. They've appeared on some of the most renowned stages in North America such as Carnegie Hall, Rockefeller Center, and Canada's National Arts Center. They've performed with the Boston Pops, the Portland Symphony, and on one occasion even sang as back-up for a major recording artist (Chip Taylor's album &quot;Some of Us,&quot; Warner Brothers). 

Key to the group's popularity is their easy, musical style and stereo-like sound, which they developed in their early days of &quot;[[woodshedding]].&quot; Encouraged by this sound the four literally took to the street, singing on Boston street corners for appreciative couples and students. 

&quot;You could say we took quartet harmony back to the streets where it flourished at the turn of the century and through the 1920's in the United States&quot;. 

&quot;Needless to say we were encouraged by the reaction we were getting from the people who enjoyed it.&quot; Like any fledgling musical group, the quartet initially sang anywhere people would listen -- in coffee houses, Harvard Square, outdoor malls, and other public gathering spots like historic Boston Common. Hence, their name. 

During the years they competed, 1971-1980, the group was noted for openly criticizing the SPEBSQSA [[BHS Contest Judging|system of judging]]. It was (and remains) the practice for competition judges to serve as coaches for the very quartets they eventually score in contest. The quartet believed that this practice was a monumental hindrance to both impartiality on behalf of the judges and creativity among quartets (resulting in the judge-coached quartets to sound similar to one another).  The bass of the quartet openly attacked the practice as questionable. 

The quartet went so far as to protest by NOT competing in the 1976 International competition, a move which many speculate prevented them from winning the Championship in ensuing years. Not that they cared, however, for the quartet sang primarily for their own enjoyment and for audiences who appreciated their efforts. 

After receiving a silver in 1979, the members agreed that 1980 would mark the last year they as a quartet would compete in International competition. Imagine their surprise when, in Salt Lake City, Utah, they were finally awarded the highest honor a barbershop quartet can achieve: International Champions. 

However they would not be able to enjoy their success for long. While on the way to work one morning in 1982, the lead Rich Knapp, was involved in a devastating automobile accident which not only left him totally deaf in one ear, but unable to tune. 

The quartet then turned to Tom Spirito, lead of the popular, two-time silver medalists [[Four Rascals]] and Knapp’s inspiration, to fill in. They performed on limited basis with Rich recovering and coming back to sing lead again. The BC performed on the [[AIC]] Show in 2005 to mark the 25th anniversary of their historic win.

'''Grandma's Boys'''

In the summer of 1968 a high school quartet from Wilmette and Glencoe, IL rode a Greyhound bus to Cincinnati, checked into the &quot;Y,&quot; sat in the back row at the international contest and listened in awe as quartets like the [[Western Continentals]], [[Mark IV]], and [[Golden Staters]] won the top medals. They had recently named the quartet, and 11 years later, when three of the original four ran onstage in Minneapolis to claim their own gold medals, it still bore the name Grandma's Boys. 

Jay Giallombardo (bari), Hank Brandt (lead), John Miller (bass), and Jeff Calhoun (tenor) were singing in three different high school quartets when they first got together in the spring of 1968. 

Their determination to stick together was rigorously tested over the next few years. John and Jay went off to college (in Peoria and Kansas, respectively); a year later Hank and Jeff enrolled in Dartmouth in New Hampshire, spreading the quartet over 1,500 miles. Somehow they continued to rehearse and give shows (usually at the same time, Hank later admitted). 

Then Jeff moved to Denver and was replaced by Jim Sikorski, and the quartet jumped from 10th place in international competition in 1974 to 3rd place in '75. But Jim had to drop out, and Mac Huff, then a Society music man, recommended Don Barnick of Cleveland. After only a few weeks of rehearsals with a new tenor, Grandma's Boys placed sixth in the next year's contest. The combination proved the right one, however; in 1978 the quartet won the silver medals, and in '79 they walked offstage with the Landino Trophy.

'''Bluegrass Student Union'''

As teenagers, Allen Hatton, Ken Hatton, Dan Burgess and Rick Stabb began singing together as The Bluegrass Student Union quartet in December of 1973, They were active members of the International Champion Chorus, The Louisville [[Thoroughbreds]]. Their first year together resulted in a first place finish in the fall Cardinal District (Kentucky and Indiana) contest. 

During this time, they also built a repertoire of arrangements &quot;borrowed&quot; from famous quartets of the time, such as the [[Citations]], [[The Suntones|the Suntones]], the Club House 4, et al. Singing with the perennial champion Thoroughbreds provided the fledging quartet plenty of encouragement, as well as opportunities to perform on &quot;the big stage.&quot; 

In 1975, the &quot;boys&quot; first met their coach Don Clause, who recognized what he called &quot;simpatico&quot; within the group. Don introduced BSU to then unknown arranger and future International President of the Barbershop Harmony Society [[Ed Waesche]], who provided the ensemble's first original arrangements. BSU also enjoyed the benefit of Don's technical knowledge and fine interpretive skills, which resulted in the quartet's quick rise to the top of International Competition. The quartet finished fourth in 1976, sixth in 1977, and won it all in 1978 with its four singers ranging in age from 22 to 24. 

After winning, the Bluegrass searched for a new mission and rediscovered the true joy of entertaining through concerts and recordings. The quartet subsequently became known as one of a very few champion quartets who did its best work after winning the gold. They innovated with adaptations of &quot;Swing Era&quot; music to the barbershop style, not only by Ed Waesche, but also by Walter Latzko, who had achieved fame through his arrangements for the famous professional quartets, The [[Buffalo Bills]] and The Chordettes. By focusing on all aspects of their performance, BSU's &quot;show package&quot; became one of the most popular in the Society's history. Also, with the help of their expert recording engineer, Bobby Ernspiker, BSU simply [[#Recordings|outperformed everybody else]] where quartet recordings are concerned. 

For twenty years, even while spending so much time in the studio, the quartet continued to travel and perform, covering hundreds of thousands of miles in 46 states and several foreign countries and entertaining millions of quartet fans, including President Reagan at the White House. In 1992, the group decided to take a sabbatical, to focus on careers and families. After being contacted by members of the &quot;Harmonet&quot;, an internet barbershop harmony discussion group, the quartet was persuaded to re-release [[#Recordings|its recordings]] in a complete works 3-CD set, with extensive liner notes. 

As a result, there was a strong resurgence of interest in live performances by the Bluegrass, and so they have been lured back to the boards. They recently retired again and released a DVD of performances and remain close friends – the same original foursome after over 25 years of &quot;good close harmony&quot;.

'''Most Happy Fellows'''

Seven has to be the lucky number of the Most Happy Fellows, who were crowned international quartet champions in Philadelphia in 1977, one of only 18 quartets who won the gold the first time they medaled in international competition. 

This edition of the quartet was seven months old; baritone Jack Lyon had only joined in January. In the three previous years, the &quot;Haps&quot; placed 21st, 14th, and 7th, all numbers divisible by 7. On the 7th day of the 7th month of the 77th year, they were the 7th contestant to appear in the finals - and won the gold. The plane that had brought them to Philadelphia was - what else - a Boeing 747 (of course!). 

Bass Ken Hawkinson was the only member of the original foursome by the time it reached the top. He had organized and named the group in 1967 with the only-half-prophetic comment that &quot;this will be a fun quartet, not competitive!&quot; Bob Hodge came along about a year later, replacing Harry Aldrich as lead. Bob moved to tenor when lead Larry Hassler joined in '71. 

In January 1977, Jack replaced baritone Bob Jones. One of the unusual strengths of the Haps was that Bob, Larry and Jack (and now Tom), all experienced barbershoppers, could (and did...and still do!) switch parts at will. After an early '90s, three-year stint with Matt Rice on bass, the Haps' configuration changed one more time, in 1996, when Tom Wilkie joined the group. 

Although long an entertaining foursome, thanks in large part to Larry's comedic talents, the Haps' popularity soared after they became champions and introduced their best known personalities to the audience at the 1980 [[AIC]] Show: Dorothy, the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz. 

In 1989, Most Happy Fellows, the first international medalists from the [[Evergreen District]], were inducted into the Evergreen District Hall of Fame. 

They have now officially retired after many years of thrilling audiences everywhere.

'''Innsiders'''&lt;br /&gt;
''written and researched by Grady Kerr''&lt;br /&gt;
''taken from Golden Memories - The History of the [[Southwestern District]] - pub 1996''

The ninth quartet from the Southwestern District to win the gold medals was also the very first quartet from Houston to appear on the International contest stage. The Innsiders began in 1967 when John Devine joined the Tidelanders chorus. He picked Guy McShan to sing bari. Both had been in Port Arthur's Spindletoppers quartet. They asked tenor Johnny Wiggs and bass Dick Oury to join their new quartet. These four were the first of 13 Houston chapter members who, over the next 19 years, made up the Innsiders quartet.
 
The championship version first sang together in September of 1971. They decided to set goals. They first wanted to become a popular show quartet and win a few contests. Six weeks later they placed third in the district contest and were being booked on many shows around the SWD. From that point on it was a steady rise.
 
Mike Cox joined the society in 1962 and worked as supervisor for an LTV subsidiary at NASA's Johnson Space Center. He had directed church choirs and was well known as a &quot;cut up&quot; and added a humorous touch to the quartet. 

John Devine was a charter member (1962) of the Port Arthur chapter before moving to Houston in 1967. He worked as a purchasing agent for Texaco. Named music director of the Tidelanders chorus in 1970, John immediately led them to a fourth place finish in Atlanta. 

Guy McShan, a sales engineer for General Electric, joined while in high school in 1950. As a Dallas chapter member Guy sang in several quartets one of which was the Doo Dads, 1965 Southwestern District quartet champions. He had also been a member of the Grand Prairie and Port Arthur chapters before moving to Houston.
 
Dr. Tom Pearson was an orthodontist who joined the Houston chapter in 1967. Pearson had served as show chairman, assistant director, and chapter president. In 1969 Tom won the district quartet championship with The Debonaires. Tom was an accomplished pilot and often flew the quartet to out of town performances. 

The Innsiders qualified for the Atlanta International and placed 15th in 1972. That same year at district they moved up a notch and came in second behind the [[Dealer's Choice]]. With their sights set on the next prelims, a quirk of fate stepped in.

Guy won a sales contest at work and a trip for two to Spain. Trouble was, it was during the prelims weekend. Shirley McShan got 51 percent of the vote and the McShans headed off to Spain leaving the three Innsiders behind at Prelims as spectators (at International, the OK 4 placed sixth and the DC won it all). 

This turned out to be a stroke of luck. Not going to International enabled them to afford the time and expense of attending the week-long Harmony College that summer of 1973 in Birmingham. The DC had done this the year before and it worked very well for them. DC lead, Bill Thornton encouraged the Innsiders to make the trip and they were glad they did. 

At Harmony College they were coached by the best the society had to offer: Mac Huff, Billy Ball, Burt Staffen, Harry Williamson, Jack Hines and Harlan Wilson. They also met and worked with Don Clause for the first time. This week of intense work changed the quartet. They began singing better with more control and creating a &quot;bigger&quot; sound. 
This new approach of working harder and smarter was evident that fall when the Innsiders took the Southwestern District quartet championship by a 219 point margin in Oklahoma City. It also could be the reason why they made such an incredible jump from 15th place in the 1972 International to fourth in 1974 at Kansas City. 

Having now become a popular show quartet and having won a few contests&quot;, the quartet set new goals ... with a gold medal being number one on the list. They took advantage of coaching from Roger Blackburn and arrangements from Dennis Driscoll. They also continued to seek help from Don Clause working sound and Arnie Bauer on stage presence. They planned on everything going into the 1975 International in Indianapolis except one thing ... The [[Happiness Emporium]] who out sang 'em. The Innsiders came in second. 

After Indy they produced their [[#Recordings | first album]] entitled Innside Out (1976). It included many of their popular contest and show tunes like Show Me Where The Good Times Are, Who'll Dry Your Tears?, Pal Of Mine, My Buddy, The Straight Life, Exodus and the outlandish Poisoning Pigeons in the Park. 

Over the next year they concentrated their efforts and worked even harder. In addition to each individual having a daily vocal workout, the quartet rehearsed three times a week. Each was scheduled in detail. They spent the first 30 minutes singing scales followed by vowel sound matching and lots of unison and duet singing. During run-throughs of the contest sets the wives would help coach the stage presence making it a complete &quot;team effort&quot;. They considered the ability to work well together their &quot;innside strength&quot;. 
Armed with new songs and arrangements by Einar Peterson and Ed Waesche they began rehearsing EVERYDAY and even worked on a high school stage for every rehearsal three weeks prior to the big contest. In San Francisco they found a small church auditorium to work in away from the crowds. They knew the job they had to do and decided to forgo the &quot;conventioning&quot; in order to win the contest.

That's not to say they didn't have fun that week. The excitement of singing three sets on the International contest stage with thousands cheering you on and then finally winning the top prize in barbershopping must be considered the ultimate thrill.

On returning home several chapters wanted the new champs to appear on their annual show. Some of the lucky Southwestern District chapters were San Antonio, Houston, Lake Charles, and Sabine Area. In addition they appeared on shows around the country and several tours of England.

One highlight was the royal treatment they received in Salt Lake City by the demented Salt Flats quartet. Each member and spouse was given a beautiful suite at the hotel. It all seemed a bit too &quot;normal&quot; until they found four bottles of &quot;welcome to Salt Lake City&quot; champagne iced down in the toilet. 

They were the headliners for the next International Mid-winter convention held in Orlando, FL. One could have asked them in San Francisco.. “You just won the International quartet championship . . . what are you gonna do now?&quot; And they could have answered. . . &quot;We're Goin' To Disneyworld!!!!&quot; . . . cause they did. 

During this time they continued to rehearse twice a week and learn new songs. That led to their [[#Recordings | second record album]] in late 1977 called On Top Of The World. It included Runnin' Wild, Ten Girls Ago and a favorite show tune, Dangerous Dan McGrew. They also recorded one side of an album for the society entitled Best Of Berlin (1978) highlighting the songs of Irving Berlin. 

[[#Recordings | Two other recordings]] were also released, The Way We Were (with Sikorsky - late 1980), and Till We Meet Again (with Litman and Erickson - 1982). Each of their records included a fine balance of uptunes, ballads and novelty songs which is one of the reason they're still favorites of any collection. 

Also in 1977 they traveled to Lubbock to tape a special TV show. It was entitled &quot;That Old Barbershop Style&quot;, produced by Grady Kerr and syndicated for use around the country. Many chapters used the tape to promote the Society on their local TV stations.
 
They appeared the next year as outgoing champs at the International and as their swan song sang their &quot;Swan-nee&quot; Parody (customized from the OK 4's act). It was the story of the ugly duckling (pun intended) and perhaps somewhat auto-biographical. They had always considered themselves &quot;four average barbershoppers&quot; with only moderate musical backgrounds and only able to win it all with lots of helps from coaches and lots of hard work. 

Over the next ten years the Innsiders would evolve through three tenors, Jim Sikorsky (1979), Ken Litman (1980), and Lloyd Erickson (1982). At a reunion of the &quot;Innsiders Alumni Association” in 1982 it was figured that the history of the Innsiders covered nine different versions of the quartet and 13 members. 

Their last show was in Berlin following the Salt Lake City convention in 1986 where they performed during a week long tour of Germany. The championship version last sang together for a Houston chapter installation banquet in the late 90’s.

Tom went on to sing in quartets and won another district quartet championship with the Inns 'N' Outts in 1985. He won the Senior Quartet gold in 2005 with [[Texoma Sound]].

John has directed the Tidelanders to a total of four district championship but is now retired from waving his arms. His quartet, The Main Event, won the district quartet championship in 1988. 

Guy has moved to Bryan, TX sang with the Bryan/College Station chapter along with his old friend Dennis Driscoll. He was also a member of the Inns 'N' Outts when they won the top district prize in 1985. Guy was also an active member of the Fort Worth Texas Millionaires directed by his son Phil. 

Mike has been active in chapter and quartet activities in Beaverton, Oregon but has moved back to Texas in recent years.

== Extended History ==
The '''Happiness Emporium''', 1975 International quartet champions, is living proof that experience pays off. 

The &quot;Emporium&quot; members averaged 37 years of age when they won gold medals. Their collective experience, even before they came together for the first time in 1972, included participation in 24 international contests and with three district champion quartets, plus four USO tours to the Pacific. 

So they decided to put it all together and go for the gold. As The Harmonizer reported in January 1976, &quot;It was a hand-picked quartet. They picked each other...&quot; All from the Twin Cities of the [[Land O' Lakes District]], they were Bob Dowma, tenor; Rod Johnson, lead; Bob Spong, baritone; and Jim Foy, bass. 

They recognized, of course, that know-how alone would not do the job. They dedicated themselves to their goal as probably few other quartets, before or since, have done. They scheduled rehearsals or performances at least three times, and often four or five times, a week. One stopped smoking. They took up jogging, aerobics and dieting. 

They continued voice lessons under Jeanne Traun, one of the top vocal teachers in the country, and began working with noted quartet coach Don Clause. 

At the same time, they never gave up the fun. As audiences throughout the nation learned, the Happiness Emporium was one of the most aptly named quartets around, spreading laughter and happiness wherever they appeared. 

Seven months after formation they placed 24th at the contest in Portland. The next year they were 9th, and in Indianapolis in 1975 they leaped to the gold. 

When Bob Spong retired from the quartet in 1983, Dick Treptow sang with them until 1987, and then Rick Anderson replaced Dick on bari. 

They continue singing today and are one of the most active of our gold medals champs. They also perform as The Good News! Gospel Quartet, have released [[#Recordings | several popular CDs]] and host an outstanding Gospel Sing at every BHS International convention.

== Extended History ==
'''The Regents'''

When the Regents won the international quartet championship at Kansas City's 1974 contest, it may have seemed to some that they had an easy road to the gold. It was their fifth international contest, and they had placed third on two previous tries, in 1972 and '73. 

But collectively tenor Harry Williamson, lead Joe Mazzone, bari Ron Knickerbocker and bass Hal Kauffman had logged 44 years of experience in nearly 25 different quartets. They lived in four different (albeit small and neighboring) states. And they comprised a quartet that had evolved through four editions since it was formed in the mid-1960s. 

Harry was the only member who lasted through all four versions. In 1970 he teamed up with Ron (then a lead), Hal and Dave Reed as bari. When Joe left his previous quartet, the Exclusives, in 1971, to take the lead spot, Ron moved to bari. 

Interestingly, Hal had been a tenor (and even, at one time, a boy soprano) until a few years before, when Harry persuaded him to switch to bass of a previous quartet so that he, Harry, could sing tenor. 

The combination, complete with the various part switches, proved the winning one, as the Regents made their &quot;rapid&quot; climb to the gold.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13918">[[Image:1973Pic.jpg|right|border|Dealer's Choice]]The '''Dealer's Choice''' is the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]]'s 1973 [[International Quartet Champion]].

In 1973 four dedicated, determined young men from Dallas, with two years of grueling, almost daily work behind them, &quot;came out of nowhere&quot; in Portland to win the international title on their first try. 

The Dealer's Choice thus became the first quartet in 21 years (since the Four Teens in 1952) to collect the gold in its first international competition (a feat also duplicated by Acoustix in 1990). They were (from top to bottom) Al Kvanli, Bill Thornton, Brian Beck, and Gary Parker. 

The championship was the goal they had set for themselves in 1971, and with one change of personnel (Bill moved from bari to lead, replacing Louie Mullican, when Brian arrived), they made it in less than two years. 

Ten weeks after Brian joined the quartet it placed fifth - out of the money - in the 1972 international prelims. It was the last contest the D.C. would fail to win. They passed up the international contest in Atlanta that year to attend a Society HEP (Harmony Education Program) school in Racine, WI. 

They came back raving about the talents of Harlan Wilson, Don Clause and other faculty members, and with 54 hours of cassette tapes of their training sessions. Rehearsing over and over the HEP school techniques, they won the Southwestern District contest in October 1972 and the international prelims in March. Then the work intensified - a minimum of one rehearsal each day of the contest songs, each run-through timed by stopwatch. They lived with their contest material 24 hours a day. 

In Portland they &quot;followed the book&quot; - bypassing the fun and late hours, rehearsing steadily, keeping their voices in shape (and drawing curious glances from other contestants) by speaking seldom and humming constantly into small hand towels. 

It all paid off, as the retiring champs, the Golden Staters, hung gold medals around the necks of the &quot;unknown&quot; Dealer's Choice.

'''Dealers Choice'''&lt;br /&gt;
''written and researched by Grady Kerr''&lt;br /&gt;
''taken from Golden Memories - The History of the [[Southwestern District]] - pub 1996''

&quot;From out of nowhere&quot; was the common answer by spectators as well as the society's editors in response to the sudden appearance by the 1973 champs, Dealer's Choice. . . and they were almost correct. They were only the sixth quartet to win the gold medals on their very first attempt.

This over-night success took less time than most, only about two years, to achieve. The Dallas Big D chapter quartet first formed in July of 1971 with Al Kvanli (Roustabouts) - tenor, former Texas Boys Choir member whose dad sang with the Fort Worth chapter, Gary Parker - bass, Louie Mullican singing lead (later of the Main Attraction) and Bill Thornton (from the Playbills) singing bari. The DC had some unique voices to blend together so the road was a bit rough learning to balance chords, 

Despite their hard work, they placed a disappointing 7th at the 1971 district contest. The judges critique convinced them that no amount of hard work was going to fix the natural mismatch.

In late 1971 while singing in the back of a bus returning for a singout, they woodshedded a few songs with Brian Beck (Doo Dads). The sound really clicked and so some changes were made. Bill moved to lead and Brian was asked to sing bari. Thankfully no hard feelings were held by Louie who became one of their biggest fans. They also transferred to the new [[Vocal Majority | Dallas Metro]] chapter. In March they placed a respectable fifth at prelims in Arlington. 

Still not having won district or qualifying for an International contest they decided to attend [[Harmony College]] in Racine, Wisconsin and the new quartet coaching seminar with the society's very best coaches. This decision proved decisive and set the quartet on the road to the gold. 

After a week of intense coaching, 12-hour days and learning from such legends as Harlan Wilson, Billy Ball, Bert Staffen, Jack Hines, Mac Huff and Don Clause, they were a “new” quartet. They also returned with 54 hours of audio tape of their sessions to help them retain the techniques taught. The young VM also learned this information as the DC were section leaders and passed along the information gained. 

The Dealer's Choice was excited and anxious to try out their new sound for the judges at the 1972 Lubbock Region 5 prelims. They won by a huge 150 point margin and felt confident that this was the start of something big. 

In their professional lives Al was a teacher at SMU, Bill had his own advertising/sales promotion agency, Brian was a professional jingle singer and musician, and Gary worked as an actuary-trainee for Southwestern Life Insurance Company. 

With coaching from Ray Anthony and Nancy Bergman, the DC competed in the district contest in October of '72. It was a two-horse race from the start between them and the up-and-coming [[Innsiders]]. The DC surprised even their closest friends with a special touch of original stage presence. While starting their last song, You Can Have Every Light On Broadway, they loosened their ties, Bill removed his coat and in a &quot;Sinatra-like-move&quot; hung it over his shoulder in a rare casual stance. That might have made the difference. The Dealer's Choice won by only 8 points in that nail-bitingly close San Antonio contest. 

The battle to be one of the two Southwestern District quartets going to Portland was fought in Port Arthur in March of 1973. The DC won the contest and worked with Don Clause and Mac Huff, two of their favorites from Harmony College. Clause traveled to Dallas several times and spent many long weekends working with the quartet as they developed their smooth blend and artful interpretation. Clause also reinforced a positive mental attitude and the idea that they COULD win the gold medals on their first time out.
 
Ninety days before the contest they rehearsed EVERYDAY, sometime as long as four hours. By the time the Portland contest came around they were ready. After the first round they led by 19 points. It was during that set they &quot;wowed&quot; the audience with Who'll Take My Place with the now famous bell chord tag. From that point on the audience began talking about this unknown foursome getting into the top ten. After the second set, and the Sinatra Move&quot; they led by 61 points and many started thinking they might medal. 

Their last set during the final top ten was just as impressive with two uptunes, How's Every Little Thing in Dixie and a Beck original Songs Like Daddy Used To Play. Few could have really predicted the outcome. Winning on the first time out was next to impossible in these modern times. 

Only seven have won on their first attempt: '39 [[Bartlesville Barflies]], '41 [[Chord Busters]], '42 [[Elastic Four]] '51 [[Schmitt Brothers]], '52 [[Four Teens]], '73 Dealer's Choice, '90 [[Acoustix]].

In reality, the Pacificaires and the [[Regents]] did better in the finals, but the DC had already amassed such a lead, they won by 104 points. The announcement of the Dealer's Choice winning the championship was quite a thrill and a shock (notice the deer-in-headlights gaze by the quartet in the official convention photos). 

Unlike other winning quartets following the convention, the DC didn't do a lot of shows. They were virtually unknown and it took a few years for their popularity to grow. By 1975 they were doing about 30 shows a year out of town. A few show highlights include a one in December of 1973 in Boston with the [[Boston Common]] who were, reportedly, crazy.

There were the stories of weather related travel problems, lost luggage and almost being thrown in jail in El Paso that every top quartet encounters. One “brush with death” story stands out. On leaving Ponca City after a 1975 show, Pilot Brian Beck (who often flew the quartet to and from gigs) had to use the taxiway to take off due to a closed runway. With Brian sitting on two phone books in order to see where they were going, they took off in a cross wind and were nearly blown into the control tower. That day they almost gave their lives for barbershop. 

Their [[#Recordings | &quot;first&quot; album]] was a rare release by the [[Ontario District]] of the Dealer's Choice In Concert. It was recorded live at that districts' 1974 fund raiser for international quartet funds annual show &quot;Onta-Fame&quot;. That year they also appeared on a PBS special taped in Dallas by KERA. The program was shown around the country and very popular.	

In 1974 The DC began working on their “second&quot; album. [[#Recordings | Songs Like Daddy Used To Play]] was self-produced and released in early 1975. It included most of their contest material. In fact it was one of the few &quot;all barbershop&quot; albums by an International quartet champion. They dedicated it to the [[Harmony College]] staff. 

Almost everyone has a copy of their 1976 release, [[#Recordings | Choice II]]. This was a trend setting album with one full side being The Elegy To The Old South or better known as their 18 minute &quot;Riverboat Medley&quot;, it was seven songs linked together with narration, sound effects and a elaborate arrangement by Brian and Gary. The flip side included I'm My Own Grandpa, Love Letters, Coney Island Washboard, and The Lord's Prayer. The graphics of the album and even the original concept itself set this one album apart as possibly the finest and most popular quartet recording in the society's history.

[[#Recordings | Songs of Yesterday]] was a Society project album with the DC singing (actually sight reading) several straight barbershop songs. The Society released it with a song book and part tapes allowing every member to &quot;sing with the DC&quot;. Thanks to the extreme pressure of their fans, The DC's first, last recording was called [[#Recordings | The Last Session]] and released only on cassette tapes. 

By this time, Greg Lyne had replaced Brian who had moved to California. This recording included many of the show songs performed over the years: Chloe, Have a Little Talk, Simon and Garfunkel Medley, I Can't Give You Anything But Love and Sweet She Ain't

Their last song together was during a week long tour of England in 1978. Their last, last recording was released after a reunion of the DC in 1988 with Greg Clancy singing tenor. [[#Recordings | Like The First Time]] (1989) included many re-recorded favorites of the past and a few new songs like I Don't Know Why, a Beck original Mr. Piano Man, Please.., Hello Mary Lou and the popular Beach Boys Medley. Rick Robertson replaced Gary Parker for a short time after Gary relocated to Virginia.

One unfortunate note was the price paid by this quartet on the home front. Over the course of the life of the quartet, every member suffered the loss of a wife through divorce. This even tested the strength of friendships within the foursome when, what is common knowledge, one member married the ex-wife of another member. This has been the source of some humor over the years, however, with the sales promotion of a fictitious bumper sticker that reads, &quot;Honk If You Were Married to a Member of the Dealer's Choice&quot;.

'''Where Are They Now?''' 
Al is a professor of statistics at The University of North Texas in Denton. He and his wife Elaine live in Carrollton, Texas. In 1982 he won another SWD quartet championship with Texas Gold.

He's also sang with Earl Hagn in Players and competed in a Senior’s quartet called Cactus Jack. He and his significant other, Dale Syverson, who directs the International champion RichTones [[SAI | Sweet Adeline]] chorus, live in Richardson. 

Brian is a business entrepreneur as well as a professional musician (producing, arranging, and singing). He went on to direct the Vocal Majority to their third district championship in 1977. He won his second district quartet championship in 1977 with the Forty Acre Four, his second gold medal (singing lead) with the [[Side Street Ramblers]] in 1983 and his third district quartet championship with the Great Stage Robbery in 1993 singing bass. While living in Colorado he sang bass with the popular Saturday Evening Post and placed in the top 10 at Int’l several times. Brian recently won the Senior Quartet gold medal with [[Eureka!]] His wife Holly (daughter of famous Sweet Adeline Renee Craig) is an active member of the Rich-Tones and active with the [[AIC | A.I.C.]] They live in Flower Mound, Texas.

'''Golden Staters'''

The long road to the gold by southern California's Golden Staters, 1972 quartet champions, was marked by a number of &quot;firsts&quot;. 

They were the first foursome ever to win all five medals (although the [[Boston Common]] later duplicated this feat), the only one to place in every position from seventh to first, and certainly the only quartet to compile this enviable record with three different leads: Jim Meehan, Ken Ludwick and finally Milt Christensen. 

Organized in 1960, the original quartet consisted of tenor Jack Lang, lead Joe Rook, bari Buddy Yarnell and bass Mike Senter. 

Through dozens of personnel changes over the next few years, Mike was the only member who remained, and all the others freely acknowledged him as the leader, composer-arranger, musical director and in-house coach of the Golden Staters. 

The composition of the quartet stabilized somewhat in late 1961 with the return of brothers Gary and Jack Harding (their second &quot;tour of duty&quot;) as tenor and bari, respectively. But it was 1970 before Milt Christensen was transferred by his company from Salt Lake City to California, and he became the final GS lead. Milt had been lead of the Salt Flats, one of the nation's most popular comedy quartets, which decided early in 1970 to retire the pitch pipe. 

Milt was the lead in New Orleans in 1971 when the Golden Staters placed third (for the second time), and he was on hand the next year in Atlanta to help them win the gold.

== Extended History ==

'''The Gentlemen's Agreement''', 1971 International champion, is one quartet that really was an &quot;overnight success.&quot; Almost, anyway. 

Organized in December 1969, it qualified for the international contest in the spring, went to Atlantic City in July and came home with fourth-place medals. The following year, in New Orleans, the Detroit-area quartet won the whole ball of wax. 

But why not? Two of its members (baritone Glenn Van Tassell and tenor Al Rehkop) claimed their second gold medals in New Orleans; they had been half of the [[Auto Towners]], 1966 champions. And the other two, lead Drayton Justus and bass Bob Whitledge, were equally talented, long-time barbershoppers, even though they didn't have medals to show for it. 

Glenn, Bob and Drayton had been directors or assistant directors of three different choruses; Al, an accomplished composer and arranger, was responsible for many of the quartet's songs. 

One week after winning the gold the G.A. accepted an invitation to make a 17-day tour of South Vietnam. From the decks of ships to forward-area bases to hospitals they entertained US servicemen, singing 41 shows in a little over two weeks. Greg Backwell, formerly of the [[Nighthawks]], replaced Glenn in about 1973, and Drayton later joined [[The Suntones]]. The quartet retired, then reorganized two or three times but finally shelved the pitch pipe in the mid-80s.

== Extended History ==
'''Oriole Four'''

The real beginning of the Oriole Four, 1970 International champion quartet, was in 1951 outside a Baltimore high school - although no one, of course, knew it at the time. That's when students [[Fred King]] and Jim Grant first met, discovered they had a mutual fondness for harmony and sang an impromptu duet. They joined the Society a couple of years later, found two other students who liked to harmonize and formed the Deacon Four, with Jim on lead and Fred on baritone. 

The quartet, with occasional personnel changes, was still getting together now and then after its members had graduated, and in 1956 the name was changed to the Oriole Four. Bass Don Stratton came along in 1957; tenor Bob Welzenbach joined the others in 1958, and a winning combination was solidified. 

All were members of the Dundalk, Maryland chapter, and three weeks after their first rehearsal they won the Dundalk Open and later the Chesapeake Bay Open. It was in 1958 also that they met Bob Loose, who was to become their permanent coach and close friend. After working with him for only three months, they won the [[Mid-Atlantic District]] championship. 

But then the hills got steeper. Although they placed eighth in their first international competition in 1959, it would be 1965 before they again reached the finals and '69, in St. Louis, before they won their first medal, a fourth-place bronze. But the next year, in Atlantic City, 12 years of work and dedication paid off, and the Oriole Four were the new champs.

'''OC Times'''

''Joy, Relief, Pride, Exuberance, Nervousness, Bliss, Apprehension, Release, Elation, Humility, Liberation, Anxiety, Delight, Gratification, Honor …''

What is it like to win International? The new champion OC Times felt ALL these emotions and more. 

Shawn York (Tenor), Sean Devine (Lead), Patrick Claypool (Baritone) and Cory Hunt (Bass) for winning the coveted gold medals in Nashville during the Barbershop Harmony Society’s 70th annual convention and contests. 

They performed three consistent contest sets to win by 51 points (2700 / 2690 / 2684 = 8074). After placing 18th, 5th, 3rd, and 2nd the past four years, OC Times has been inching closer to their goal with each attempt. Their song selections have been unique and contributed to their rapid growth and popularity. 

They competed with “Don’t Be a Baby, Baby”, “Oh, Look At Me Now”. “I Want You, I Need You, I Love You”, “You’re Sixteen”, “You Belong To Me” and “Drivin’ Me Crazy”. Competing with these songs made popular by the likes of Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Ringo Starr and Patti Page has expanded the barbershop realm to the delight of most. 

They call Orange County, California home and are active members of the Masters of Harmony chorus, seven time international chorus champion. They are ALSO active members of Westminster, the 2007 international chorus champion. With their win of quartet gold medals they become only the third quartet to win CHORUS gold medals the same year. 

OC Times formed in the spring of 2003. Shawn, Sean and Patrick are the original members. Their original bass was Drew Harrah. He won the FWD title with them and placed 18th in Louisville in 2004. In January 2005 Cory joined the group. The rest is, of course, history.

Their song selections have been unique and contributed to their rapid growth and popularity.

They competed with “Don’t Be a Baby, Baby”, “Oh, Look At Me Now”. “I Want You, I Need You, I Love You”, “You’re Sixteen”, “You Belong To Me” and “Drivin’ Me Crazy”. Competing with these songs made popular by the likes of Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Ringo Starr and Patti Page has expanded the barbershop realm to the delight of most.

They call Orange County, California home and are active members of the Masters of Harmony chorus, seven time international chorus champion. They are ALSO active members of Westminster, the 2007 international chorus champion. With their win of quartet gold medals they become only the third quartet to win CHORUS gold medals the same year. 

OC Times formed in the spring of 2003. Shawn, Sean and Patrick are the original members. Their original bass was Drew Harrah. He won the FWD title with them and placed 18th in Louisville in 2004. In January 2005 Cory joined the group.

'''Getting to Know You'''

'''Shawn York – Tenor – age 33'''
Originally from Rescue, California, Shawn resides in South Corona, CA.  He began singing barbershop shortly after seeing a bumper sticker that read “Want to sing barbershop? Call 1-800-876-SING”. The rest is history.  Shawn earned his bachelor’s degree in Music Education from Vanguard University, and currently owns and operates a Chick-fil-A restaurant in South Corona. Whenever they get the opportunity, Shawn and his lovely Hawaiian wife, Lani, enjoy vacations to Oahu, HI. They have three young children.

Shawn joined Society in 1996 and is already a four-time gold medalist with the Masters of Harmony, as well as the tenor section leader for the 2007 and 2010 International Champions, The Westminster Chorus.

Currently living in Nashville, TN, Sean comes to us originally from &quot;The Sweetest Place on Earth&quot;, Hershey, PA.  Sean joined the Society in 1995 and moved out west in 2001 to pursue a career in music, performing full-time with a professional doo-wop group, The Alley Cats.  They sang many high profile gigs including the 2006 Harmony Foundation Show and were the opening act at the Mirage Casino in Las Vegas for Jay Leno for over a year (two weekends a month). He’s still singing with the “Cats” on a substitute basis.

In July 2008 Sean relocated to the Barbershop Harmony Society headquarters in “Music City, USA” to work as a Major Gifts Officer with Harmony Foundation International.

''A Letter from the Boys

Dear Friends,

I guess it's time to take that step and admit to ourselves that sometime we have to come down from the high we've been on since July 5th. It's almost impossible to explain just what winning the quartet and chorus championships means to us, but I guess that's part of the year as a champ … coming to grips with the reality that all the rehearsals, the time on the road, hours spent coaching and the many shows and tags shared with friends have really paid off. It's an odd feeling, fulfilling a lifelong dream … it's part relief, mostly elation and a healthy portion of shock.

The past few months have been full of hard rehearsals, chorus practice, coaching and somewhere in there, work and loving our families. We'd be remiss if we were to forget to acknowledge several key people and organizations that have nourished OC Times to where we are today.

Our choruses: the Reno Silver Dollar Chorus, the Westminster Chorus and the Masters of Harmony. Our mentors and friends, Rob Menaker, Jeff Baker, Brett Littlefield, Mark Hale and Aaron Dale. Our loving families; mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, wife (Lani York), daughter (Kalea York), and girlfriends. Your patience, guidance, support and love made all of this possible. We truly could not have done it without you. Finally, we thank our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for the talents He gave us, the loving people He put in our lives, and the opportunity to share His love through our music.

The past few months have also brought much change for the OC Times family. Baby Kalea York, is the light of both Shawn and Lani's lives and a particular highlight in ours as well. Cory graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno in May and moved to Lake Tahoe to work at an environmental policy and consulting firm. Furthermore, Patrick is getting back to work on his &quot;ten year plan&quot; at Orange Coast College. Finally, Sean graduated from Azusa Pacific University and recently accepted a position with the Harmony Foundation in Nashville, TN at the beautiful BHS headquarters.

With all this change, many of you may be wondering &quot;whatever is going to happen to OC Times?!&quot; We want you to know... we're going to be around for a long, long time. We love innovating, performing, entertaining, teaching and sharing with barbershoppers, youth and any audience that is willing to lend us an ear. We're always accepting shows, youth harmony camps and other performances - and we don't see an end in sight.

On a much more serious note, we also recently lost a good brother in harmony, Rich Hasty, a fellow member of the Masters of Harmony, comedic genius, accomplished arranger, esteemed judge, great friend and loving husband and father. His sudden passing reminds us all that our time here is so short … we're so blessed to be a part of such an amazing family of barbershoppers. 

At a recent Masters of Harmony retreat, we were urged to remember that for some people in the audience -- and even on the risers -- it may be their last … little did we know how true those words would become. Pray for the Hasty family for strength during this trying time and find comfort in knowing that Rich is singing praises in the &quot;chorus in the sky.&quot; It was an honor knowing you, Rich.

That same family lifted Cory up when he was injured earlier this year. Your cards, emails, teddy bears and prayers paid off and he is making progress with his vision daily. All of these events have made us realize how truly great is to be a barbershopper. We count ourselves blessed to be a part of this wonderful family.

We are humbled and honored to be your quartet champions. We promise to represent you well -- to close out all the afterglows we can, sing tags with any willing singer, teach the youth, support our choruses and spread the love of barbershop to audiences wherever we are privileged to go. We look forward to what exciting things the coming years have for us, and for barbershop. Until we meet again.

Sincerely yours,

Shawn, Sean, Pat and Cory

== Extended History ==
'''Max Q'''

After placing second three years in a row, Max Q were finally crowned 2007 International Quartet Champs. They won the championship with the second highest score (at the time) and by the second highest margin of victory ever. 

Max Q began in 2002 and after toying with the idea of a quartet. At their first official meeting the sound was special and exciting. It’s no wonder. All four were experienced singers. 
----
'''Greg Clancy''' (tenor) started as a 12 year old kid on the front row of the young [[Vocal Majority]] with his dad up front directing. He has been a part of all eleven VM championships. He sang with several quartets through the years like Class of the 80’s (Dan Bell, Jason January, Todd Wilson). Gatsby (Bill Thornton, Jason January, Gary Parker) and a re-united [[Dealer's Choice]]. Greg is said to now have the most gold medals of anyone in the Society (12). 
----
'''Tony De Rosa''' (lead) is also a second generation Barbershopper, starting at the age of seven with his dad, Papa Joe. An active quartetter, he first appeared on the International stage with Cypress Chord Club at the age of 12 in 1985. He sang with One Shot Deal, became the youngest gold medalist as bari of [[Keepsake]] (1992) and won his second gold medal with [[PLATINUM]] (2000). 
----
'''Gary Lewis''' (bari) studied at Bowling Green State University where he formed his first quartet, Which Wayz Up? , He was the tenor of [[The Real Deal]] and winners of the Society’s MBNA Collegiate Quartet Contest in 1994. 

Gary moved to Orlando FL in 1996 and sang as a replacement bass singer for the 1992 Champion [[Keepsake]]. 

In 1998, Gary switched voice parts again, and moved to tenor to sing with [[PLATINUM]]. With Joe Connelly singing lead, Tony De Rosa on baritone, and Kevin Miles singing bass, Platinum captured the gold in Kansas City in 2000. 

Gary was the first person to win a collegiate gold medal and go on to win SPEBSQSA International gold. He is also the only tenor/baritone double gold medalist. 
----
'''Jeff Oxley''' (bass) is a product of Bowling Green State University in Ohio, where barbershop music was very popular. That inspired the formation of [[The Rapscallions]] (Dave Smotzer - tenor, Dave Wallace - lead, and Tim Frye - bari) and their entry into the 1982 International contest and a surprising 9th place finish. They began working harder and moved up to 6th place in 1983 and won it all in 1984. In 1986 he moved to Dallas and later joined Class of the 80s who placed 14th at International in 1989. After a new lead and a name change, [[Acoustix]] won the gold in 1990, his second. 

As an active coach, section leader and featured soloist with the [[Vocal Majority]], Jeff has won seven chorus gold medals. In late 1997 he took on the challenge of Music Director in California with the International chorus champion [[Masters of Harmony]]. He led them to their 1999 win and has become the only man in BHS history to have won 3 quartet golds and directed a chorus to the championship. 
----
Although Max Q were hindered by distances (two in Dallas, one in Florida and one back in Ohio) they managed to learn their music via weekends together and learning CDs, and rehearsed as often as possible. Max Q’s first appearance was as a cameo on a Vocal Majority chorus show. 

Their work in the studio has produced two outstanding CDs with one being a ground breaking collection of children’s songs - For the Children. 

By their fourth year of competition and being second three years in a row (a major accomplishment for ANY quartet) they introduced a new song, Here’s To The Losers with special lyrics developed and arranged by quartet coach [[Clay Hine]] ([[FRED]] bari). 

Some of the lyrics include: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Here’s to those who go for high notes even when they’ve past their prime. &lt;br&gt;
(bass solo) Here’s to every bass who has an ego half as big as mine. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Here’s to the [[Nighthawks]] and the [[Pacificaires]] -- we love that [[Sundowners]] sound &lt;br&gt;
To the [[Vagabonds]] and all of the greats that never won the crown &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Here’s to the Losers - bless us all 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Their 'Losers' set received the largest audience reaction of the week and perhaps their career. It was a highlight for the boys. After being the first to congratulate [[Gotcha!]], [[Realtime]] and [[Vocal Spectrum]] before they ran up the stairs to proudly accept their silver they finally got to hear their name announced as the champs in Denver 2007.

== The Max Q Journey ==
''By Grady Kerr''

You’ve heard that it’s the journey and not the destination.  That’s true with our new champs as they certainly took the long way around to win their new gold medals. As with Homer’s Odysseus, they also discovered new insights along the way.

After placing second three years in a row, Max Q (Greg Clancy, Tony De Rosa, Gary Lewis and Jeff Oxley) finally reached the end of the journey and were crowned 2007 International Quartet Champs during the recent Denver Convention of the BHS. 

This was certainly very satisfying to the guys given the past four years of hard work, extra effort and disappointments. In the end Max Q made their mark. The boys won the championship with the second highest score and by the second highest margin of victory ever.

'''How All This Got Started'''
Max Q first sang together in 2002 during the Portland Int’l convention.  Tony, Jeff, and Greg had toyed with the idea of singing together, and Tony suggested Gary as a potential bari.  The four casually sang around and liked what they heard.  

The first official meeting occurred in Dallas in September of that year.  The sound was special and exciting. After matching socks, they needed a name and offered a prize to anyone on the Harmonet who could find the best one.  After four full pages of suggestions the winner was Jeff Baker ([[Nightlife]]).

Early on they decided to be a [[Southwestern District]] quartet and represent the District of Champions winning the district title in 2005 (Jeff’s first) 

Max Q’s first appearance was as a cameo on a VM show.  They were hindered by distances (two in Dallas, one in Florida and one in Ohio) but they managed to learn their music via weekends together and learning CDs, and rehearsed as often as possible.  

Their first full shows were for the Tampa [[Heralds of Harmony]] in June of 2003, the [[Harmony Foundation]] Show in Montreal, Canada, and the [[Buckeye Invitational]] in August of 2003.  What a way to start!

'''Max Who?'''
'''Greg Clancy (tenor)''' 
started as a 12 year old kid on the front row of the young [[Vocal Majority]] with his dad up front directing. In many ways he has followed in [[Jim Clancy]]’s footsteps by growing into the associate director of the VM and singing professionally in the active jingle market of Dallas, Texas.  As one of the few who have won all 11 gold medals with the VM it’s said he probably now has the most gold medals of anyone in the Society (12).

One of his first quartets was formed for a chapter quartet contest and named the Tone-Ails.  They won and stayed together after thankfully changing their name to [[Class of the 80s]]. They won the 1987 SWD title. (Dan Bell, Jason January, Todd Wilson (bass))  Greg dropped out to sing with [[Gatsby]] (Bill Thornton, Jason January, Gary Parker), placing 9th at the [[BHS Intl Quartet Contest 1984|1984 International]], and 6th in the [[BHS Intl Quartet Contest 1985|1985 International]]. He later sang tenor with the un-retired [[Dealer's Choice]].  Greg owns PRO MOTION Music, a fitness music company and Tug Clamby Music, a royalty administrative company.  He is also Music Director of JonesTM in Dallas, where he composes, arranges, produces and sings retail jingles and radio i.d.’s. 

He and wife Luann were married in April 2000 and have two kids, daughter McCaa (5) and son Jack (3).

'''Tony De Rosa (Lead)'''
is also a second generation Barbershopper, starting at the age of seven with his dad, Papa Joe.  Tony credits his Dad as having a major influence on his music career. He has been an active quartetter first appearing on the International stage with [[Cypress Chord Club]] at the age of 12 in 1985, [[BHS Intl Quartet Contest 1985|placing 38th]]. He later sang with Roger Ross (on lead) in [[One Shot Deal]] (International: [[BHS Intl Quartet Contest 1988|31st in 1988]], [[BHS Intl Quartet Contest 1989|21st in 1989]], [[BHS Intl Quartet Contest 1990|35th in 1990]]).  He sang bari with [[Keepsake]] and placed second in 1991 and won his first gold medal at the age of 19 (the youngest ever) in 1992.  From there he joined [[PLATINUM|Platinum]] and placed 2nd in 1999 and won his second gold medal in 2000.  Taking over for Papa Joe in the Winter of 1993, he is a former director of the Tampa [[Heralds of Harmony]] chorus and took them to nine International Chorus competitions, placing as high as [[BHS Intl Chorus Contest 1997|9th in 1997]]. Tony is a five time district champion (1984 / 1988 / 1991 / 1999 / 2004).

Currently, Tony is the Music Director for Epcot’s Voices of Liberty and “subs” with both the Dapper Dans of Walt Disney World and Four For A Dollar at MGM Studios. He is an active studio vocalist including his own learning CD business, Barbershop and Sweet Adeline coach, and music director of the [[Toast of Tampa Chorus|Toast of Tampa]] Show Chorus.  In his “spare” time, Tony serves on the worship team at his church (Northland) and loves time at home in Orlando with his wife Jodi and their four children: daughter Sophia (2), son Joseph (4) and two daughters, Alec and Kayla.

'''Gary Lewis (Bari)'''
is from Toledo, Ohio where his interest in music began early.  He studied at Bowling Green State University where he formed his first quartet, &quot;Which Wayz Up?,&quot; which was the Varsity Quartet for the Men's Chorus. Gary sang bass along with Carl J. Cash III singing tenor, David Calland ([[Uptown Sound]], [[The Allies]]) on lead, and Jon Jenz on baritone. 
 
He was the tenor of [[The Real Deal]] and winners of the Society’s [[BHS Intl College Contest 1994|MBNA Collegiate Quartet Contest in 1994]]. Also in that foursome were Eric Kauffman singing lead, David McCutcheon, bass and Jeff Oxley’s younger brother Justin. When Justin moved to San Antonio, Sean Oliver joined on tenor, and Gary moved to baritone.  They competed in the 1996 International and [[BHS Intl Quartet Contest 1996|placed 38th]].
 
Gary moved to Orlando FL in 1996 to sing professionally with Disney's acclaimed &quot;Voices of Liberty.&quot; Gary's voice can be heard on the Liberty Voices CD, &quot;A Slice of A Cappella.&quot; While living in Orlando, he began singing as a replacement bass singer for the 1992 International Champion Quartet [[Keepsake]]. 
 
In 1998, Gary switched voice parts again, and moved to tenor to sing with [[PLATINUM|Platinum]]. With Joe Connelly singing lead, Tony De Rosa on baritone, and Kevin Miles singing bass, Platinum placed second in 1999 and captured the gold in Kansas City in 2000. Gary was the first person to win a collegiate gold medal and go on to win SPEBSQSA International gold.  He is also the only tenor/baritone double gold medalist.
 
He’s also director of the [[Pride of Toledo]] Sweet Adelines Chorus.
 
Gary is a music educator and the new Director of Choral Activities at Solon High School in Solon, Ohio (the Cleveland area).  The [[Footnotes]], 2006 [[SAI Rising Star Champions]], are his former students.  Gary has two children: Adam (son, 8), Jenna (daughter, 6).  He and his fiancé Joy Makowski will be married December 28, 2007.

'''Jeff Oxley (Bass)'''
was a product of Bowling Green State University in Ohio where barbershop music was very popular. That inspired the formation of [[The Rapscallions]] (Dave Smotzer - tenor, Dave Wallace - lead, and Tim Frye - bari), their entry into the 1982 International contest, and a surprising [[BHS Intl Quartet Contest 1982|9th place finish]].  They began working harder and moved up to 6th place in 1983 and won it all in 1984.  In 1986 he moved to Dallas and later joined [[Class of the 80s]] who [[BHS Intl Quartet Contest 1989|placed 14th]] at International in 1989.  After a new lead and a name change, [[Acoustix]] won the gold in 1990, his second. 

As an active coach, section leader and featured soloist with the [[Vocal Majority]], Jeff has won seven chorus gold medals. In late 1997 he took on the challenge of Music Director in California with the International chorus champion [[Masters of Harmony]].  He led them to their 1999 win and has become the only man in BHS history to have won 3 quartet golds and directed a chorus to the championship.

Jeff is actively employed as a first call studio vocalist in Dallas. His voice can be heard worldwide on Radio/TV jingles and commercial IDs. He and wife Susan were married in 1999 and have two children. Son Blake is now 6 and they recently adopted a daughter, Lily Grace who is 22 months.

'''Competition History'''
After last year’s on stage announcement of Max Q placing second, an unfair observation was made when they didn’t appear on stage right away. That speculation suggested Max Q was so disappointed they were reluctant to appear. Truth was that all four were taking time each year to be the first to congratulate [[Gotcha!]], [[Realtime]] &amp; [[Vocal Spectrum]] before they ran up the stairs to proudly accept their silver. Each year, on hearing the second place announcement, each member conducted themselves in a professional manner and was gracious his placement. This should serve as an example for others.  Let the record show that Max Q has class.

Most multiple gold medal winners experience a bit of an up hill struggle. Even though Max Q didn’t form JUST to win again, the audience acceptance was slow in coming. Not to say they weren’t cheered and encouraged, they were. But their performances at Internationals were not always accepted with a standing ovation. 

The tide seemed to turn last year during the second set with the audience reaction to their heartfelt rendition of “Little Pal”.  They received an extended audience reaction and that mood carried over to this year. Perhaps some recognized that the quartet has grown and developed since 2004.  Their For the Children CD project changed the focus of the guys and perhaps the perception of their fans. The quartet has “come together” and developed an “identity” from within and the audience can see that now.  

'''Stays Fresh Longer'''
The week in Denver started on Tuesday with an hour rehearsal each day working thru each upcoming set. This year was different as they were a lot looser in their approach. As a rule they didn’t have any pre-stage ritual or tradition, but they were much more relaxed, not nervous and less worried about the singing technique of each song this year. On stage each set was more “fresh” than before.  This paid off.

How fresh? In the six weeks prior to the contest they managed to get together only twice. In that time they added three new songs. The final set had never been performed for any audience and the “Rhythm Medley” was debuted for an afterglow audience recently. 

'''Rocky Mountain High'''
One surprise was the reaction to the Loser’s set. Recommended by Tim Brooks and developed and arranged by quartet coach [[Clay Hine]] ([[FRED]] bari), this “Sinatra” song received the largest audience reaction of the week and perhaps their career. It was hard to “hang on” during that song. In addition to the audience’s outstanding response the usually unemotional judges were unable to control themselves. The quartet could clearly see and hear them laughing out loud. It was a highlight for the boys.

During the week they received the customary “this is your year” comments from fans and were very grateful for these. They had to keep their emotions in check on stage but it was nice to hear the reactions.

By this fourth year with three being second (a major accomplishment for ANY quartet) they had to “earn their stripes”, they understood that and now accept this looking back. Winning in this way was necessary and as it should be.

They relied a lot on coaching within the quartet but respected and appreciated the coaching from Clay Hine. His honesty and perspective had a major impact on the growth of the foursome as a quartet.  He was the pen behind the “Here’s To The Losers” arrangement and special lyrics. He arranged the “Best Man” set last year. The quartet didn’t see “Losers” until June 1st and it received one of the highest possible scores with a 97.6 % in the presentation category.

== 2007 Song by Song ==
'''Quarter-finals'''
Somebody Loves Me
Arranged by Clay Hine - They wanted to start off with a “bang” and a song from last year - something they felt comfortable with.
Put Your Arms Around Me, Honey
An Aaron Dale chart (a music educator and one of the hottest arrangers working today - worked with [[Louisville Times]], OC Times and [[Westminster]]). Same as Somebody, a repeat from last year and comfortable.

'''Semi-Finals'''
Little Pal
Arranged by Clay Hine - a real hit for the quartet - they simply “sang it to our kids”
Rhythm Medley
A new song for the quartet - another super Aaron Dale chart.


'''Finals'''
Here's To The Losers
A Clay Hine masterpiece - only had it for a month - an favorite of the audience and judges. 

Here's to the winners all of us can be unless you finish second place three years in a row

well here's to those who love to sing but may not always do their best
here's to those who try to make the grade but just can't pass the test
here's to those who don't sing for a score but because they have a ball
Here's to the losers bless us all (bless us all)

Here's to each quartet who works all year but just can't make the cut
here's to those who never made it here but try no matter what
here's to those who'd love to move up just one place then we'd stand tall
Here's to the losers bless us all

(Jeff, Tony, and Gary) we were first long ago those silvers we carry are Greg's fault you know

Here's to those who go for high notes even when you've passed your prime (he's passed his prime)
Here's to every bass who has an ego half as big as mine
To the guy who bet the last three years that Max one Q would win it all 
here's to the losers yeah bless us all

you know it's true that two two two has been our due in this venue 
(we've) we've never been in front (we should) we should have cheated once

this time we almost sang our songs in tune didn't we boys 
this time we worked before the month of June didn't we boys 

a heart full of joy an' gladness is not our first wish for what's ahead 
we've looked for three years at silver linings we'd rather have gold medals instead so listen one more time

here's to the Nighthawks and the Pacificaires we love that Sundowners sound
to the Vagabonds and all 'o the greats who never won the crown 
here's to ev'ryone who's done their best but seen their fortunes fall
here's to the losers bless them all here's to the losers bless them all

(Tony is a loser and it's plain to see he can't win with-out Joe Connelly) bless us all
(Greg is a loser and 'is dad was clear he said don't come home without gold this year) bless us all
(Jeff's not a loser he's a real cool guy when you ask him he's happy to tell you why) bless us all
(Terry's a loser....Harry is a loser....Larry is a loser) &lt;guys, it's Gary&gt; &lt;whatever Perry&gt;
Bless us all bless us all

Somewhere
Jim Clancy wrote the verse and arranged it for the boys - tough song to arrange in barbershop - it was a message they wanted to leave with the audience.


As Max Q returned home they were still floating on air and unable to wipe off that smile. The quartet’s schedule is now becoming busier.  They are scheduled to appear at the final Buckeye Invitational August 17, the Sunshine District Labor Day Jamboree Sept 3, The Vocal Majority Fall shows September 21/22, a Sweet Adeline show in Michigan in October, the Spirit of the Gulf Christmas Show, and the BHS Mid-Winter Convention in San Antonio in January.

I recall asking [[Morris &quot;Mo&quot; Rector|Mo Rector]] which gold medal he liked the most. Without hesitation he replied . . . “My Next One!”

It’s the journey and not the destination.  Now, a new journey for Max Q begins.

== Max Medals - Total 29 ==
Greg Clancy - 11 chorus gold with [[Vocal Majority | VM]] (1975 - 2006) - One Quartet Gold - Max Q (2007).

'''Vocal Spectrum'''

In the closest win in the Society’s 68 year competition history Vocal Spectrum took home the big trophy by singing flawlessly and earning the best score on two of the three sets. Still it was only SIX little itty-bitty points that separated them from the future champion and three time silver medalists [[Max Q]]. 

The youth movement in the Society now has an extraordinary benchmark with these four guys winning the College Quartet Championship (2004) and the International Quartet Championship (2006) after only THREE years as a group. 

Vocal Spectrum first sang as a one-time educational quartet for a workshop with Francis Howell North High School Men's Ensembles on January 5th, way back in 2002. They liked what they heard and continued singing after that chance grouping. 

They hail from St. Charles, Missouri where all were majoring in different fields of study at Lindenwood University and come from various musical backgrounds, from classical vocal training to jammin' in rock-n-roll bands. 

Tim Waurick (tenor) is the newest member of VS joining in September 2003 replacing original tenor David Cassel. Tim sang in Good Times at International in 2001 and 2003 

Eric Dalbey (lead) has sung in many quartets throughout his high school career and became an original member of Vocal Spectrum in 2002. 

Jonny Moroni (bari) discovered barbershop through a local public access channel and soon joined the [[Ambassadors of Harmony]] (St. Charles, MO) He has gone on to win a total of 5 International Medals with the chorus. 

Chris Hallam (bass) sang in select ensembles throughout high school and joined the Ambassadors of Harmony (2004 International Chorus Champions) and has competed at the International contest with them three times. 

In addition to performing all over the U.S. as well as singing in Germany, Holland, Sweden, Russia and England, the foursome gets a special kick out of being part of Youth In Harmony Workshops and teaching high school students about barbershop harmony. 

They follow in the recent footsteps of [[Four Voices]] who won the college gold medals in 1996 and the quartet gold in 2002. Vocal Spectrum is the FIRST quartet to win THREE of the possible 5 gold medals (Collegiate Quartet, Men’s Quartet, and Chorus Medal).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10673">[[Image:1969Pic.jpg|right|border|Mark IV]]The '''Mark IV''' is the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]]'s 1969 [[International Quartet Champion]].


Luck and the US Government - combined, of course, with the well-known Rector talent - won Morris &quot;Mo&quot; Rector his second International gold quartet medal in 1969. San Antonio's Mark IV was the champion that year, and C.O. Crawford had been the bass of the quartet from its beginning. He was with tenor Franklin Spears, lead Al Koberstein, and bari Dale Deiser when they placed third in Los Angeles in 1967, and again - although he barely made it - when the quartet won the silver in Cincinnati in '68. 

But C.O. was a State Department employee, subject to being sent on short notice to the Mideast or some other trouble spot for a few weeks or a few years. Mo, who had won his first medal with the Gaynotes in 1958, usually filled in for C.O. on shows while he was gone. 

In 1968 C.O. made it back from Jordan just one day before the Southwestern District prelims, qualified with the quartet and won a silver medal in Cincinnati. A week later Uncle Sam called again. The message this time: two years in Morocco. 

So Mo was the bass at the '69 prelims and again when the Mark IV won the championship in St. Louis in July. C.O. later returned, Mo left, and the quartet filled engagements for several years before disbanding. 

Most went on to other quartets or to even greater accomplishments - especially Franklin Spears, who became a justice of the Texas Supreme Court.

== Extended History ==
'''The Mark IV'''
''written and researched by Grady Kerr''&lt;br /&gt;
''taken from Golden Memories - The History of the Southwestern District - pub 1996''


The roots of this gold medal quartet come from several fine Southwestern District foursomes and include many outstanding singers. The story probably begins in San Antonio in 1962 with Dale Deiser, of the 1960 district champ Playboys, looking for a new quartet. He was able to recruit bari John McCord, bass Mike McCord (no relation) and lead Ben Binford, all fine quartetters. 

In the spring of 1963 they qualified for International contest at prelims in New Orleans but only placed 40th in Toronto. The contest was a disappointment however, they had fun at the convention singing with the Chordsmen who placed 4th. After the convention Mike left to join the Checkmarks and C. O. Crawford replaced him in late 1963. The Checkmarks became Southwestern District champs a few months later. 

The Mark IV were alternates to their “own” International (held in San Antonio) in 1964. Each worked on the convention committee helping with the auditorium as well as being the official mic testers. They disbanded by the end of the summer. 

It just so happened that in that 1964 contest was a quartet from the Evergreen District called the Journeymen with a young lead named Allan Koberstein. On enlisting in the Air Force, Allan was stationed, like many other San Antonio members, at Lackland Air Force base.

Meantime the Mark IV re-formed in 1965 with Charley Ward singing tenor and in 1966, for a few weeks, tenor Seth Moore joined them and went to prelims. They attempted to qualify but were again alternates. 

Songwriter and friend Jack Stern asked the Mark IV and the Checkmarks (who often performed together as the Markmen Octet) to record a special song for Lady Bird Johnson. Frank Bloembaum arranged it and some guitars were used. One of Lady Bird's quotes was, “If the Lord be willin' and the creek don't rise”. Jack sent it to her in 1962 while still first lady, but he never heard back. 

In 1966 The Marksmen had the pleasure of singing for Lady Bird Johnson during a dinner to honor her &quot;Keep America Beautiful&quot; project. They told the story and sang the song. It was the first time she had ever heard it and thanked each octet member personally. 

Left-over from the original Mark IV, Dale and C.O. grabbed Allan and by August of 1966 found Franklin Spears, tenor of the Playboys, ready to sing again. This combination clicked and three months later, they won the Southwestern District quartet championship in Houston. They then set their sights on International competition. This began a steady rise to the top. In the 1967 International they placed a strong and thrilling third in Los Angeles. 

C. O. worked for the State Department teaching English to foreign pilots and was at risk of being sent, on short notice, to the Mid-East. He returned from a 13-week assignment in Jordan just a week prior to the 1968 prelims. Luckily, the Mark IV qualified for International and placed second in Cincinnati. A week later, C.O. was told of his new assignment, two years in Morocco.

Mo Rector had moved to New Braunfels from Tulsa in December of  '66 leaving behind the Gaynotes and 12 years of active quartetting. He had already filled in for C.O. several times. He now replaced him on bass. There was some speculation as to whether or not the quartet could maintain its momentum after placing second in 1968.

All four members were active members of the San Antonio Chordsmen chorus. Franklin had joined them in 1957. A dedicated public official, he had served the state of Texas as a State Representative, a Senator and was a well known attorney/district judge. Dale was drafted into the Army while in Oregon, was transferred to Fort Sam Houston and joined the Chordsmen in 1958.

After two years stationed at Fort Sam Houston, he retired from the service and began working for a member of the chorus' moving van company. Mo had joined in Okmulgee, OK in 1949 and joined Tulsa in '53. Allan started in Eugene, Oregon in 1958 at the age of 16. He was now the lead of a potential International champion. 

Mo and the Mark IV qualified for the International and went from rehearsing 3 to 4 times a week to singing every night the month before the contest. They figured there were (including performances) 550 man-hours spent that month preparing for the contest. They were helped by coaches Lynn and Mike McCord, and top arranger Joni Bescos. 

They took St. Louis by &quot;storm&quot; and impressed the Kiel Auditorium crowd by singing I'd Give a Million Tomorrows, and Piano Roll Blues. This gave them a commanding 120 point lead after the first round. In the end, The Mark IV won their gold medals by a 163 point margin. 

The Southwestern District contingent also was thrilled by seeing the Houston Tidelanders come in second in the chorus contest. It had been eleven years since one of our quartets had won and the victory was sweet. The quartet, keeping with tradition, sang all night and then met with Society VIP's for a celebratory breakfast. They also had to appear on local TV and even sing. They admit the only one who still looked good was Mo who had forgotten to take off his stage makeup. It was only fitting. Mo had become the very first society member to repeat as a gold medalist. 

They began their championship year singing all over. They set aside one weekend a month to stay home, but toured the country the other three. Following their win they sang for several Southwestern District chapters (Dallas Town North, Midland, Corpus Christi, Houston, and Baton Rouge and Austin). The Mark IV was dedicated to maintaining standards. They attempted to put as much work into singing in a corner after chorus rehearsal for a few fans as they would for an audience of 5000.
 
Like their predecessors, they preserved their songs by releasing two outstanding quartet recordings. In 1967 they released Swing Low. It featured many of their show tunes such as the Gaynotes Cabaret, That's Life, Among My Souvenirs, Sam, the Accordion Man, and perhaps their most popular I'd Give A Million Tomorrows. 

In 1970 after winning, many fans were begging for another record. They answered with a trend setting release entitled Anything Goes. It was a very popular release and included songs like Don't Blame Me, It's Magic, the Carpenter's Close to You, Struttin' Down The Main Street of Dublin City, and That Lucky Old Sun.

Mo returned to Tulsa at the end of 1969 (and didn't appear on either record) and the quartet continued to travel and sing with bass Pete Tomseth filling in until C.O. returned from Morocco in the summer of '71. 

Their last chord together was in Lubbock on April 20, 1974. C.O. was again transferred, this time to Iran and Allan decided to move back to Oregon and his father's business. He did return in 1979 and sang with Dale in The Good Time Delegation for a year. 

Around 1986 San Antonio held a special night at the Pearl Brewery. It was a reunion of old quartets and the Mark IV appeared. Many say they were as good as ever. The Mark IV had a very unique sound and much credit can go to Allan as an outstanding lead. His smooth voice, paired with C.O.'s low bass enabled the quartet to pitch 'em low and gave the quartet a wonderful dimension - one not yet equaled today.

C.O. has retired and moved to Oklahoma City and joined the OK Chorale. He sang in Oklahoma Sound for a time with Jim Massey. 

Allan is inactive and still living in Salem, Oregon working for the school district there. 

Dale is only in three quartets. He sang in the Good News Gospel Quartet and participate at the International Gospel Sing. Along with his wife, June, he still sings with Jan and Marci Scofield in Mixed Company. Both of these groups have been active ten years. 

Franklin went on to become a Texas Supreme Court Justice retiring in 1991 following a successful heart transplant.  He was named to the Southwestern District Hall Of Fame in 1988. He passed away April 10, 1996 at the age of 64.

Mo was also named to the Southwestern District Hall of Fame in 1989 and died December 6, 2003 in an automobile accident. He was 69.

== Extended History ==

'''Western Continentals'''

A funny thing happened to the Western Continentals on their way to the 1968 International championship. In 1965, only a year after they first got together, Dr. Curt Kimball, Ted Bradshaw, Paul Graham and Terry Diedrich placed eighth in the International competition. 

Then Curt, the tenor, was called to service in Vietnam and was replaced by Al Mau. They dropped to 21st in '66. 

They went to Los Angeles in '67, not only with Al but with a new bass, Phil Foote, replacing Terry. They won the silver medals. The next year, in Cincinnati, they captured the gold. 

If a native Arizonan still lived in Phoenix in the 1960s, he wasn't with the Continentals. Al was from Wisconsin, Ted (the lead) from Ohio, Paul (bari) from Michigan, and Phil from Detroit (by way of El Paso, thanks to the Air Force). Curt had come from Oklahoma. 

The quartet was &quot;on again, off again&quot; for a decade after winning the championship. Al moved to California in 1971 and was replaced by Frank Friedemann, but they disbanded in '72. Phil had also left, but by 1973 both he and Al were back, and the Continentals resumed shows until a job transfer took Phil away again. He returned a second time in 1977, but the quartet hung up the pitch pipe for good in 1979.

Realtime was rare in that the quartet's contest scores improved every time they competed. Even in 2005, when they surprised everyone to win, their scores increased with each round of competition.

This quartet brought to light a style of singing that was effortless, free, relaxed and yet produced an incredible ring like audiences had never heard.

== History ==

Realtime formed when four young but experienced barbershoppers from three different nations found themselves living within one hour's drive of each other in early 2003.

It all began in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada as two brothers Mark (bari) &amp; Tom Metzger (bass) grew up singing together following in the footsteps of their father, Charlie. They were a matched set in every quartet through the years; The Edge, Sonic Boom and Counterpoint.

Around the same time, John Newell (lead), was singing barbershop in Australia. He is a two-time [[Barbershop Harmony Australia]] (BHA) quartet champion (1999 / 2001) with Southern Cross (lead). He is also the first International Champion singer to have been born and raised outside North America. 

In the 1990s, a young tenor named Tim Broersma started singing on the International contest stage with his father, Doug. He won his first district quartet championship at age 14 in 1993 with Milky Way. He was also active in Studio One, Counterpoint and Bachelor Party. 

They would all cross paths and decide to travel this road together as four brothers. 

The name Realtime was chosen by crossing all other ideas off a list, yet reflects their desire to be &quot;in the moment&quot; when performing.

They held their first rehearsal in March of 2003 and performed for their first show with their home chapter (Greater Vancouver / Gentlemen of Fortune Chorus) in June. In 2004 they represented the [[Evergreen District]] in Louisville and placed 7th in their first International contest together. Later that year they won the Evergreen District Quartet Championship. The following year, they won the International Gold Medal in Salt Lake City.

John Newell retired from the quartet at the beginning of 2008 due to commitments with his young family. Doug Broersma, Tim's father, became the Lead until Tim also retired from the group in 2011 for his young family. 


== Recent History and Reformation ==

Realtime has reformed as of 2015 and is performing occasionally. Their most recent appearance was as headliners for the [[Westminster Chorus]]'s show in April 2015.

== Extended History ==
'''Four Statesmen'''

It's not unusual, with today's modern highways and plane connections, for members of a quartet to live some distance apart. But in the mid-1960s, when the Four Statesmen were working their way toward the 1967 International championship, it was almost unbelievable that a quartet could live in four different states. 

Yet such was the case for tenor Frank Lanza, Providence, Rhode Island; lead Dick Chacos, Nashua, New Hampshire; bari Richard &quot;Doc&quot; Sause, Meriden, Connecticut; and bass Don Beinema, Worcester, Massachusetts. 

Twice weekly they drove a total of 800 miles to rehearse. What's more, they continued the long distance harmonizing from the time the quartet was organized in 1963 until it disbanded at the end of 1978 - a total of more than 15 years. 

The Statesmen were all &quot;old pros&quot; in the barbershopping world when they first got together. Frank had been a member for 17 years and had sung in four quartets from three chapters. Dick Chacos, a 14 year veteran, had made the International finals five straight years, 1959 through 1963 with his quartet, the Merry Notes. Doc Sause had been a member for 22 years and had sung in both chorus and quartet competition on the International stage - in the latter case with the Connecticut Yankees. And Don had been a member of three different quartets in his 12 years with the Society before joining the Statesmen.

'''Gotcha!'''

At an afterglow in September of 1996, four members of the [[Masters of Harmony]] chorus decided to sing a song. Three hours later, Garry Texeira, Chris Vaughn, Alan Gordon, and Scott Wilson exhausted the entire repertoire from three choruses and a few international championship quartets! Shortly after the 1996 [[Far Western District]] contest, Gotcha! became a registered quartet and bought matching socks. 

The quartet spent 1997 moving through the competition ranks, including sweeping the Grand Championship at the [[Buckeye Invitational]]. Riding high from first year successes, Gotcha! qualified for their first International Quartet Contest for 1998, and were encouraged with their 20th place finish in Atlanta. 

Upon returning, they immediately turned their focus to the 1998 Far Western District Contest in Phoenix, where they came home as the 1998 FWD Quartet Champs. They placed 12th in 1999 and 8th in 2000. They changed basses before the 2001 contest with the addition of Jim Kline (formerly of Buck Thirty-Nine and [[139th Street Quartet]]). 

The quartet climbed through 8th, 6th, and 2nd in the world before capturing the International Championship in Louisville, KY, in July of 2004. This made Jimmy’s 30th appearance on the International stage beginning in 1970. 

Gotcha! has performed hundreds of shows across the U.S., Canada and Ireland - on stage, radio, and television and has produced [[Gotcha!#Recordings | three outstanding recordings]].

== Extended History ==
'''Auto Towners'''

While several barbershop quartets have gone on to professional careers (the Hi-Los, Four Freshmen and Osmond Brothers, for example) the Auto Towners, 1966 International champions from the Detroit area, drew at least one of its members from a professional singing group. 

Baritone Clint Bostick in the early 1950s was with the &quot;Spellbinders&quot;, a mixed quintet that sang for two years on the Patty Paige television show, appeared for 13 weeks each on the Vic Damone and Tony Bennett shows and sang for 17 weeks with Judy Garland at the Palace Theater in New York City. 

Female soloist of the group was Renee Craig, to whom Clint introduced his wife, Bobbie. Renee and Bobbie soon formed the Cracker Jills, who would claim the 1957 [[SAI | Sweet Adelines]] quartet championship. Thus Clint and Bobbie became the first husband and wife team to win gold medals in both the men's and women's organizations. 

(Don and Carol Ann Bagley became the second when Don's quartet, the [[Chiefs of Staff]], won in 1988.) 

It was two other members of the quartet, however - lead Glenn Van Tassel and tenor Al Rehkop - who would go on to make further headlines in the barbershop world. Both won their second gold medals as members of the [[Gentlemen's Agreement]], 1971 champions. 

Rounding out the Auto Towners was bass Carl Dahlke, an 11-year barbershopper who had sung in several quartets and directed the Chordomatic Chorus to the [[Pioneer District | Michigan District]] championship in 1965. The Auto Towners continued to thrill audiences throughout the nation until their retirement at the end of 1969.

'''Power Play'''

Nothing can compare with the Power of family. Power Play consists of a father, his two sons, and his nephew. 

Jack Slamka, the father, sings bass and is a 30-year member of the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]]. Michael, his son, sings lead and is a 20-year member of the Society. Don, the nephew, sings tenor and is a 17-year member of the Society. Mark, the other son, sings baritone and is a 15-year member of the Society. 

Power Play was formed in 1988, and won the [[Pioneer District]] (Michigan) quartet championship in the fall of 1989. 

They competed in international competition a dozen times (six in the top 10) and finally won in 2003 in Montreal. 

This quartet proves that the family that Plays together stays together.

'''Four Renegades'''

Every gold medal quartet crowned by the Society in its 50-plus year history has been a great one. A handful - the [[Schmitt Brothers]], [[Confederates]], [[The Suntones]] and a few others - went on to become legends. The Four Renegades, 1965 champions, was one of the legends. 

Organized in 1957 for the [[Illinois District]] contest, the Renegades originally consisted of Jim Foley, bari; Joe Sullivan, lead; Warren &quot;Buzz&quot; Haeger, tenor; and Tom Felgen, bass. Joe left the quartet in 1963 and was replaced by Ben Williams. For the next 14 years, by personal appearances, radio, TV and records, they would bring pleasure literally to millions. 

In their climb to the top they had paid their dues: Ninth in Dallas in 1960, seventh in '61, third in '62 and '63, second in '64. Finally, in 1965 in Boston, The Renegades heard the announcement they had worked so hard to earn - gold medalist.

== Extended History ==
'''Four Voices'''

When Chad (lead) and Brandon Guyton (bari) attended a Harmony Explosion presentation in 1993, they had no idea what lay ahead. 

A few years later, they recruited two fellow Lee University musicians, Lester Rector (tenor) and Jayson Van Hook (bass), to form Four Voices. Contrary to popular belief, the name was not inspired from the obvious; a requirement to fulfill the prerequisites of a quartet. 

Actually, these young men met in the [[Voices of Lee]], a 16-member vocal orchestra group at Lee University, where they contributed four of the eight men's voices to make a unique, harmonious sound that has gained national recognition. The Four Voices decided to enter the 1996 MBNA Collegiate Barbershop Quartet Contest in Salt Lake City and were fortunate enough to come away with the championship. 

In 1999, the quartet agreed that it was time to take a shot at the big leagues and entered the [[Dixie District]] Contest. They were thrilled to come away with the championship, but they were not finished yet. 

They set a goal to qualify for International in 2000 and reached this dream by qualifying at the Dixie District preliminary contest. In their first time out, Kansas City brought Four Voices an International Semi-Finalist award. In Nashville in 2001, Four Voices made a huge jump in the standings, bringing home the 3rd place Bronze medal. 

They won in 2002 in Portland and became the first college champ to win the BHS gold medal title. Their recordings are considered some of the best examples of the style.

'''The Sidewinders'''

Saturday, June 27, 1964, undoubtedly was the happiest day in the history of the Riverside, CA chapter. On that day the Riverside Citrus Belters chorus won 5th place bronze medals in its first International competition. And four chapter leaders, a group known as the Sidewinders, became the new International quartet champions. 

Some championship quartets, by necessity or by choice, have not always been strong members of the chapters to which they belonged. Not the Sidewinders. Tenor Jerry Fairchild had long been chorus director. Lead Joe Daniels had been president and was about to be named to that post again. Bass Jay Wright was three-term secretary. Bari Gene Boyd was past membership vice president, show chairman, and perennial committee member. 

The Sidewinders immediately became popular ambassadors of the Society. They made two major network appearances two days after winning the gold medals. A crowd of 2,000 greeted them at their first engagement as champions in California. For the next eight years they sang from coast to coast and from Maine to Mexico. 

The Sidewinders stopped accepting engagements as of June 1969, but they emphasized they would continue to sing together from time to time &quot;for our own amusement and amazement.&quot;

'''Michigan Jake'''

In 1983 Mark Hale and Greg Hollander joined the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]]. They quickly became friends and started singing in a quartet together. This quartet, the Sound System, started with Mark on tenor and Greg on baritone, but soon Greg moved to bass and Mark moved to baritone. Along with Phil Kinser, lead, and Mike Wheeley, tenor, they sang together for about five years, winning a district championship and competing at the International Competition in 1988. They retired in 1990. 

By 1992 Mark had moved to Louisville and, with David Harrington, formed the [[Louisville Times]] Chorus. David's quartet, the [[Second Edition]], had just recently retired and there was a lot of excitement over starting something new. As the chorus began to build steam a new quartet was in the works with David on lead, Mark on baritone, Greg on bass, and Mark Bowman from Cincinnati on tenor. 

The quartet became known as [[A Few Good Men]] and won the right to compete at the International Competition in Pittsburgh in 1994. As luck would have it, David and the other [[Harrington Brothers]] were immediately offered a job performing on a professional show in Myrtle Beach, so the quartet was forced to disband after being together only about six weeks. 

The desire to start another quartet hit again around the summer of 1995. The Louisville Times had just competed at their first International Competition and were in full swing. The section leaders often would step forward and demonstrate various techniques for the chorus and it was discovered that they had quite a blend. 

They were Mark on lead, Greg on bass, Gary Davis on baritone, and Mark's brother Christopher Hale on tenor. Christopher had recently moved to Louisville to attend the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, pursuing a Masters in Church Music. 

Shortly after the Miami convention the foursome started to rehearse with the [[Cardinal District]] Quartet Contest being their first short term goal. They chose the name Michigan Jake, a takeoff of the Warner Brothers singing frog, because it represented where they had first started to hear the old songs--on Bugs Bunny cartoons. 

They went on to win the contest by a much larger score than they had imagined. The quartet placed tenth in their first International Competition in 1996 and then eighth the next year. By March of 1998 they found themselves in need of a new baritone and called upon their friend Joel Wilson. 

Joel had started singing in the Louisville Times in 1993 when he was sixteen, and had grown accustomed to the singing techniques of Michigan Jake. This, and the fact that he's so darned good, made it easy for him to slip effortlessly into the Michigan Jake sound. 

With just inside of four months together, the quartet jumped to the second place silver medalist position in Atlanta that summer. 

By a strange twist of fate, Christopher had stopped on his way to the Atlanta convention to interview with a church in South Carolina in need of a new Music Minister. He discovered in a message on his answering machine when he returned home that he had gotten the job. The other men of Michigan Jake didn't want to stand in the way of Christopher's career, but they were in a difficult situation. After considering a few options, they decided to call on Drew Kirkman of Terre Haute, Indiana, with Christopher making the initial contact. Drew had sung with several quartets through the years, both on lead and tenor, but most recently with Flash Point, comprised of Drew and three members of the Times. They knew he had the ability if he had the time and desire to step in. With a single audition they could tell that they had made the right choice. 

At the 1999 convention in Anaheim Michigan Jake took the third place bronze medal behind crowd favorite [[FRED]], and in 2000 they earned another silver medal with [[PLATINUM]] winning the gold. Finally in July of 2001 in the city of Nashville, Tennessee, Michigan Jake won the coveted gold medals besting a field of fifty competitors by a margin of 256 points. 

Mark Hale moved to California and went on to direct the powerhouse [[Masters of Harmony]] chorus, leading them to three (2008, 2005, 2002) of their six chorus championships (and counting). Drew got married and moved to Florida.  He is busy singing with the [[Dapper Dans of Disney World]].

Michigan Jake retired in 2004, but their influence is still felt to this day.

'''The Town and Country Four'''

Many - in fact, most - championship quartets go through several changes in personnel before they finally reach the top. Not so the Town and Country Four, 1963 International champions. 

The &quot;T and C&quot; first got together for some woodshedding at a picnic in August 1955. From that time on, like the school board of The Music Man fame, you seldom saw one without the others. They were Leo Sisk, Larry Autenreith, Jack Elder and Ralph Anderson. 

The only change they made along the way was when Larry and Jack switched parts, with Larry winding up on lead and Jack on bari. Leo remained at tenor and Ralph on bass (frequently as a soloist). All had been members of the [[Three Rivers Chorus|Pittsburgh Chapter]] since joining the Society. 

From the beginning they set their sights on winning the International gold, and they were never deflected from that course. Even they, however, might have wondered at times if they were destined always to be bridesmaids. In their first contest (for novice quartets) they came in second. Seeking the [[Johnny Appleseed District]] crown, they placed second twice before reaching their goal. And in six consecutive appearances at International, beginning in 1957, they placed 27th, 8th, 3rd, and 2nd , 2nd , 2nd . But at Toronto in 1963 they became the Society's 25th International champions.

'''The Gala Lads'''

&quot;Experienced&quot; - and proving it - might best describe the members of the 1962 International quartet champion, the Gala Lads from Alhambra, CA. 

While a few gold medalists have been young and won while in their teens, the Gala Lads averaged 36 years of age when they won the championship. Tenor Dave Panther was 28, lead Tom Keehan 35, bari Gordon Lees 36, and bass Bill Cockrell 45. 

What's more, collectively they had sung in 16 quartets before getting together as the Gala Lads, and could count a total of 35 years of barbershopping experience. 

One of Bill's previous quartets was the [[West Coasters]], 1957 International silver medalists. For Dave, although the youngest of the group, the Gala Lads was his seventh quartet. 

Although the foursome was organized in 1958, the winning combination did not get together until 1960. A year later, in its first International competition, it placed sixth, then jumped to the top of the heap the following year in Kansas City. 

In 1964 Tom was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident, and California barbershoppers staged a benefit to raise $1,200 to help with medical expenses. By 1968 the Gala Lads were back in business with all the original members except Dave, who had been replaced by Joe May.

== Extended History ==
Platinum first organized in 1998 and soon won the 2000 SPEBSQSA International Quartet Championship in Kansas City. 

Lead [[Joe Connelly]] became the first THREE TIME Gold Medalist with this win having won in 1987 ([[Interstate Rivals]]) and 1992 ([[Keepsake]]). He learned from many outstanding quarteters including his dad Mike who sang baritone with the Roaring 20s.

Baritone [[Tony De Rosa]] was also a member of the 1992 champs [[Keepsake]], making this is second gold medal. Tony would go on to win his third in 2007 with [[Max Q]] singing lead. He first appeared on the International Contest stage at the young and talented age of 12 with his dad Joe as chorus director of the Tampa [[Heralds of Harmony]]. Tony would later go on to direct them as well.

Tenor Gary Lewis first earned gold with [[The Real Deal]], 1994 Collegiate Quartet Champs.  With PLATINUM, he became the first collegiate champion to win an international gold medal.  He would go on to win his second international gold medal in 2007 with [[Max Q]], singing baritone. Gary came from Bowling Green State University, home of an outstanding music program and several gold medal champions.

Bass Kevin Miles has been a longtime member of The [[Dapper Dans of Disney World]] (4 years), the popular “Americana” 8-part a cappella group, Voices of Liberty (21 years) and is almost as well known as “the voice” of Walt Disney World greeting the public and reminding you to “watch your step”.

Platinum is famous for their “lock and ring” as well as long posts. A good example is adaptation of the songs Be Our Guest and Auld Lang Syne, which are the titles of their two popular CDs.

They were helped by some outstanding arrangers such as Ed Waesche, Greg Volk, Walter Latzko and [[Clay Hine]] and coaches including Jim Casey, Randy Loos, and Gary Wulf.

They are now officially retired but do accept shows on very rare occasions.

Joe is working on becoming the first to win four times with his new quartet, [[Old School]], having placed 5th at International in 2008 on their first attempt and having earned two silver medals since then.

Tony and Gary are still actively singing, touring and recording with [[Max Q]].

Kevin, successfully recovering from “carrying” Joe and being the quartet’s chick magnet for all those years, is still active with the [[Dapper Dans of Disney World|Dans]] and occasionally singing with the VOL. He and his wife are involved in a company that offers singing opportunities for people who desire to perform in a chorus in large and exciting venues (www.singliveusa.com).

'''FRED'''

As you can tell by the name, FRED is anything but your typical barbershop quartet. In fact, from their distinctive sound and unique sense of humor to the speed in which they have risen to the top of the craft, very little about FRED is normal. 

FRED (Jared &quot;Pookie&quot; Carlson, tenor; Rick LaRosa, lead; Clay Hine, bari; Joe Clay, bass) was less than one year old as a quartet when they won the 1991 Dixie District Quartet Championship. 

As members of the Marietta, Georgia chapter they gained a huge following in International quartet competition between 1992 and 1999 with their creative and off the wall sense of humor with parodies and poking fun at the audience, judges and themselves. 

To the delight of their fans FRED won the barbershop quartet gold medals in 1999. They have gone on to entertain extensively across the United States and around the entire world for a wide variety of corporate and public audiences and have produced several top selling CDs. 

Clay has been a popular coach and director taking the [[Big Chicken]] Chorus to International competition several times and more recently, and a new chorus, The [[Atlanta Vocal Project]]. 

As they openly admit, a quartet by any other name would be another quartet.

'''The Evans Quartet'''&lt;br /&gt;
Trivia question: What quartet sang Lindy, Lucky Lindy for Charles A. Lindberg in 1927 and, with a couple of personnel changes, was still singing as an International champion 50 years later? Answer: the Evans Quartet of Salt Lake City, the 1960 gold medal winners. 

The song to Lindy came as he was making a triumphal tour of the country and his motorcade passed through Salt Lake City. Four young brothers, ages 7, 9, 11, and 13, stepped out from the curb to sing, in full barbershop harmony, the popular song. Lindberg ordered the car stopped, listened to the song, thanked them and shook their hands. 

The brothers were Turk, Pres, George, and Clarence Evans. Thirty-three years later, when the Evans Quartet won the gold in Dallas, the quartet was composed of Turk, tenor; Pres, lead; younger brother Jack, bass; and Gene &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith, baritone. 

Jack at age nine had ousted big brother Clarence, and Turk, Pres, George and Jack continued to sing as a quartet until 1940. Then Al Nielsen stepped in for George to sing bass through the 1957 International contest in Los Angeles. When he left, the brothers switched voice parts (Jack from lead to bass and Pres from bari to lead) and brought in Smitty as bari. 

With a couple interruptions, the quartet continued active for the next ten years. Bob Evans (a cousin) replaced Smitty in 1971. The same combination (Turk, Pres, Bob and Jack) got together again later for a production of The Music Man in Salt Lake City. That was in 1980 - just 53 years after Turk and Pres had sung for &quot;Lucky Lindy.&quot;

'''Four Pitchikers'''&lt;br/&gt;
From a high school in the heart of the Missouri Ozarks to the winners' circle onstage of the Civic Opera House in Chicago is an even longer trip than the miles indicate. The Four Pitchikers made it, though, in 1959, to become International quartet champions. But they might never have arrived if it hadn't been for a chance, once-in-a-lifetime involvement with a man who was to become one of the Society's leading arrangers and coaches. 

The original Pitchikers, natives of two tiny farming communities in southwest Missouri, were high school students; Larry Hedgepeth, Keith Keltner, Keith Young and Johnny Marriott. Bitten by the barbershop bug, they joined the [[Pride of the Ozarks|Heart of the Ozarks]] chapter and competed at a couple of district contests while still in school. They called themselves the Teen Tuners. 

At about that time (around 1950) another chapter member with a lot of musical talent was trying his hand at writing barbershop arrangements. But he couldn't find a combination of voices that &quot;played back&quot; the songs to his satisfaction. The arranger's name was [[S. K. Grundy]]. The Teen Tuners graduated, and Johnny left to take a job elsewhere. 

It occurred to S. K. that the two Keiths and Larry, plus an experienced bass, might prove the combination he was seeking. He coaxed Joe Delzell from another quartet to join what then became the Pitchikers. The rest is history. 

With Grundy's coaching and arrangements, the Pitchikers won bronze medals in 1956 and '57, took the silver in '58, and the gold in 1959. S. K. Grundy went on to coach other quartets and became on of the Society's best-known, most prolific and most respected arrangers.

'''Yesteryear'''

Representing the Maumee Valley (Toledo) and Elyria (near Cleveland), Ohio chapters and the [[Johnny Appleseed District]], Yesteryear is well known as a talented and entertaining show quartet. 

The original version of the quartet was formed in February of 1984. Over the years there were three personnel changes (and one part change) leading to the gold medal version of the foursome. Along the way they won the Johnny Appleseed District (1993) contest 

Dan Trakas (tenor), Mark Blake (lead), Rod Nixon (bari) and Randy &quot;Beef&quot; Baughman (bass) won gold in Indianapolis, Indiana. 

The guys placed 17th in 1992 on their second Int’l contest appearance and jumped up to eighth in 1992. They moved up the ranks starting in 1994 placing 3rd, 2nd, 2nd and then the ultimate quartet goal. 

Dan is a two-time JAD quartet champion having won with the Matinee Idols in 1976 and Yesteryear. 

Mark is a graduate of Bowling Green State University and Ashland Theological Seminary.  He sang tenor in the BGSU Men's Chorus (&quot;America's Finest Singing Machine!&quot;) under the direction of R.D. Mathey.  Mark has served in many Chapter and District positions including Chapter President (Maumee Valley Chapter [Toledo, OH] and Northwest Ohio Chapter [Bowling Green, OH]), Music/Chorus Director (The Fun Center Chordsmen [Mansfield, OH] and The Seaway Commanders [Toledo, OH]), and District President (Johnny Appleseed District). Mark was awarded the JAD Barbershopper of the Year Award in 2006.  He started his competitive quartet singing with the popular Varsity Lettermen, a college quartet in the JAD from 1985 to 1988. 

Rod has sung in three other JAD champion quartets. He was the lead of the Matinee Idols (1976) and Sound Syndicate (1979), and tenor of Sound Advice (1972). Rod is a past president and director of the Elyria Cascade Chordsmen. 

Beef is a former director of the Maumee Valley Seaway Commanders Chorus in Toledo and also sang with Mark in the Varsity Lettermen. A graduate of Bowling Green State University he is well known as a member of a high school 50's group called Melvin and the Nuclear Turnips. He is currently active in the International contest favorite and popular show quartet, [[Hot Air Buffoons]].  

Yesteryear was inducted into the JAD Hall of Fame in 1998.

Mark Blake retired from the quartet in the Fall of 1998 to become a full time pastor.  Tim Brooks (State Line Grocery) took over the leading, traveling with Yesteryear all over North America as well as Australia and New Zealand.  

The quartet retired in 2000 with a brief revival (with gold medal lead Mark Blake) a few laters.  The quartet retired in 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7930">[[Image:1958Pic.jpg|right|border|Gaynotes]]The '''Gaynotes''' is the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]]'s 1958 [[International Quartet Champion]].

The SPEBSQSA was born in Oklahoma, so it was no surprise when Oklahoma quartets captured the first three International (then national) crowns. But it would be 20 years after the Society's formation before the title returned to the Sooner state. 

In 1958 in Columbus, Ohio, four Tulsa men called the Gaynotes won the gold medals as International Champions. They were Harold Jones, tenor; Howard Rinkel, lead; John Loots, bari, and Morris &quot;Mo&quot; Rector, bass. Howard and John had sung in a couple of earlier quartets, including one sponsored by an ice cream company which required that they perform at least twice a week. 

When the Gaynotes formed in 1953, Larry Stayer was tenor and Dick Galloway the bass. 

Dick soon moved away and was replaced by Mo, who had started singing with quartets in high school. This combination won the [[Southwestern District]] championship in 1956, but Larry was already planning to leave. The others contacted Harold Jones, a tenor in the Tulsa chorus, as a replacement. Although Harold had no quartet experience, he showed up at a rehearsal with a tape recorder, taped 13 songs and within two weeks had learned the tenor part to all of them. 

It took the Gaynotes only two tries to win the gold; they placed third in 1957. They stayed together, with a two-year hiatus while Mo sang in a touring company of The Music Man, but disbanded when Mo moved to Texas in the mid-1960s.

== Extended History ==
=== The Gaynotes ===
''written and researched by Grady Kerr''&lt;br /&gt;
''taken from Golden Memories - The History of the [[Southwestern District]] - pub 1996''

As one of the most active and popular Society quartets, The Gaynotes set new standards for our champions and their influence is still being felt today.

The Gaynotes formed in 1954 in the Society’s birthplace, Tulsa, Oklahoma. 

Lead Howard Rinkel and baritone John Loots joined forces with tenor Larry Stayer and bass Dick Galloway. The next year, a talented young bass with a crew cut, Mo Rector, joined the quartet. They were good from the very start .In their first contest they placed SECOND behind Albuquerque’s [[Lads of Enchantment]] who would soon win the International gold medals.

Early on, thanks to Mo Rector arrangements, they established a unique and entertaining repertoire and were very active becoming a very popular show quartet. By their second year they had already traveled 75,000 miles and performed for 250,000 people. They also became quite stage savvy.  In 1956 everyone expected the Gaynotes to win the District crown . . . and they did! 

Unfortunately, tenor Larry Stayer had already decided to retire from the very active quartet schedule. Up stepped [[Founders Chorus|Tulsa chapter]] member Harold Jones. He was a quick study. In only TWO weeks and after only ONE rehearsal, with the help his hand-held dictation tape recorder, Harold learned their 13-song repertoire and was ready for shows. This was his very FIRST and only quartet. 

They soon qualified for their first International quartet contest.  At the International convention in Los Angeles in 1957 they had lots of fans and surprised everyone, and perhaps even themselves, and placed THIRD. It was there they competed with one of their most popular and trademark songs, ''Bye, Bye, Blues''.

The Gaynotes qualified for the 1958 International and began to prepare for the contest in earnest. An aggressive practice schedule played a major role. Although they had been performing once or twice a week over the previous few years, in the four months prior to the contest, they met almost every night. 

They had outstanding coaching from [[Sweet Adelines International|Sweet Adeline]] champion and arranger, Nancy Bergman, Society field representative, Floyd Connett. They soon had a new confidence, a much fuller sound and a new stance – this unique stance soon became a Gaynotes trademark.

To travel first-class to the convention in Columbus by rail from Oklahoma City only took 24 hours and $76. By air, the first-class trip took four hours and $115. The quartet decided to drive the 967 miles. Along for the ride was a new barbershopper and young 16 year old Gaynotes fan named [[Brian Beck]]. 

It was the young Society’s 20th year and we had just moved our headquarters to [[Harmony Hall]] in beautiful Kenosha, Wisconsin.

The June contest was held at the Columbus, Ohio’s Veterans Memorial Auditorium and the Gaynotes sang “Sunny Side Up”, “I Wish I Had a Girl”, “Last Night On the Back Porch”, “Can’t You Hear Me Calling, Caroline?”, “You Brought Ireland Right Over To Me” and “All American Girl”.  

Harold was 32, Howard 31, John 37 and Mo only 24. They out sang four future champs to win the gold medals by about 300 points in only their SECOND International contest.

=== Just The Beginning ===

They continued their active show schedule with an average of two major shows a month. Neither rain, sleet or snow kept them from performing. In the quartet’s entire 12 year history they only missed ONE of their 1500 shows, and that was due to an illness.

The Gaynotes’ legacy as one of the all-time great quartets is preserved in the records they made. In addition to the songs recorded for Decca contest album, the quartet made their very own record. It was entitled ''Strictly Barbershop'' and was later released in the popular Chord Record Series. It included many of their fans’ favorites from their show package. 

Having traveled over 500,000 miles to 37 states, they kept up a large repertoire, leaving the question, “Which songs should they put on their next recording?” Unable to choose, they made TWO albums. One was entitled ''Strictly Square''. A few of the songs on this album were &quot;stacked&quot; stretching the quartet to 12 parts and becoming a mini-chorus. This was a first for a barbershop record.

The other album of the set was entitled ''Strictly Swinging''. It featured more &quot;modern&quot; arrangements and instrumental tracks. Old friend [[Brian Beck]] wrote the tracks for the band, played the electric bass and led the back up group.

At seven dollars a “set”, they went through several pressings despite the Society’s refusal to accept [[Harmonizer]] advertising of a &quot;non-barbershop recording&quot;. 

In their history, the Gaynotes appear on a total of 10 albums performing 41 songs.
 
After 12 years The Gaynotes finally retired when Mo and his family relocated to Texas in December of 1966. 

=== Where Are They Now? ===

Tragically, we lost John Loots on July 14, 1990 in an automobile accident in San Francisco following the International convention there. He was 69. 

Mo Rector died December 6, 2003 in an automobile accident. He was 69.

Howard Rinkel is retired and still lives in Tulsa with his wife of 54 years, Jane. 

Harold Jones is retired and also still lives in Tulsa with his wife of 63 years, Betty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10235">[[Image:1957Pic.jpg|right|border|Lads of Enchantment]]The '''Lads of Enchantment''' is the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]]'s 1957 [[International Quartet Champion]].

While some quartets continue singing for years as International Champions, others are forced, for one reason or another, to &quot;hang up the pitch pipe&quot; soon after winning the gold. The Lads of Enchantment, 1957 winners, was one of the latter. 

And yet tenor Don Pitts, lead Dan Aycock, bari Carl Wright and bass Gil Wallace, all from Albuquerque, left their mark in some areas as indelibly as did the Suntones. 

How many quartets since then, for example, have sung Hal Staab's There's a Rose on Your Cheek or Ro-Ro-Rollin' Along, borrowed from the Sweet Adelines' Big Four Quartet and arranged by Floyd Connett? The &quot;Lads&quot; introduced both songs. When they sang what they thought was Frank Thorne's version of Love Me and the World is Mine, Frank asked THEM for the arrangement. 

They proved, also, that at least for two successive years, they were the best in their league. In the 1956 International preliminary contest, they qualified although losing to Lou Laurel's Desertaires. 

In Minneapolis they won third-place medals, while the Desertaires placed ninth. The following year the Gaynotes beat them in the prelims. But in Los Angeles the Lads took the gold, and the Gaynotes had to wait until 1958. 

Don Pitts dropped out of the quartet after its championship year, and the others decided to disband.

== Extended History ==
'''Lads Of Enchantment'''&lt;br /&gt;
''written and researched by Grady Kerr''&lt;br /&gt;
''taken from Golden Memories - The History of the [[Southwestern District]] - pub 1996''

The Lads were fine quartet that, unfortunately, didn't last long after winning the gold medals. For that reason, they are not as popular today as they were in the '50's. Back then, the Lads were one of the great quartets and very popular on the show circuit. There are very few chapters who DIDN'T have them on their annual show which made the Lads, before and after winning, a very busy foursome. 

They first formed in September of 1954 and, as with almost all great quartets, the first sounds were very encouraging. They also felt the potential and with much encouragement from fellow [[New MexiChords|Albuquerque chapter]] members and other quartets, they began working toward improvement. 

Don Pitts, 29, was a native of New Mexico and worked for Sandia Corporation (prime contractor for the Atomic Energy Commission) as an electrical engineer. 

Dan Aycock, 31, came from Arkansas. He was an administrative supervisor for Sandia Corporation. 

Carl Wright, 30, was from Vermont. He worked as an architectural draftsman with Stanley &amp; Wright. Stricken with polio as a child, Carl spent his life on crutches. To his credit, he never let his handicap affect his positive attitude, his performance or his love of singing. 

Texan Gil Wallace, once a member of the Lubbock chapter, was the oldest at 34. Gil also worked for Sandia Corporation as a mechanical engineer. 

The Lads never had a regular coach but instead closely observed the other top quartets of the day such as the [[Four Hearsemen]], The [[Orphans]], and the [[Desertaires]]. In addition to help from fellow quartetters, The Lads learned advanced barbershop craft from such society experts as Johnny Means and Floyd Connett. 

From them they gained an appreciation for the &quot;song&quot; and attribute their success to gaining the desire to ring chords with as much perfection as possible. They were blessed with a perfect lead-bass match. To add to this gift they all took voice lessons and worked on vowel matching long before the society began teaching it. 

The [[Confederates]] also helped them with this skill, being masters of it themselves. Many ever-glows were spent with the Lads and other quartetters working the finer points of expanded sound in hotel rooms till dawn. 

In their very first contest they attempted to qualify for the 1955 International by having to drive 1500 miles round-trip from Albuquerque to the San Antonio prelims. They drove all night through heavy storms to arrive and check in about 1:30 in the morning before the contest. The Regional contests were not kind to the Lads and it was indeed tough competition at the [[Southwestern District]] prelims. They did well but were named as alternates behind the [[Desertaires]] (who placed 7th at International that summer) and the [[Four Hearsemen]] (who won the 1955 International). It was a long drive home. 

They must have been doing something right because they won the district championship on November 5th, 1955 on the stage of El Paso's historic Liberty Hall in only their second contest. They won despite a partially collapsed lung suffered by tenor Don Pitts the morning of the contest. It was appropriate that they sang “Hoop-Dee-Do” as their acceptance song. 

Still fighting that regional contest jinx, The Lads qualified but came in second to the [[Desertaires]]. That summer (1956) they leaped over them and placed 3rd (in their very first International) while the Desertaires placed 9th. The next year the [[Gaynotes]] beat them in the Prelims but the Lads qualified by placing second. 

That summer of '57 in Los Angeles Dan “Potsy” Aycock remembered the three days of competition as pure work mixed with some confusion and chaos. Their hotel reservation got messed up and the Lads' entourage of family and friends ended up having to stay at a little, off-the-beaten path hotel called the Gates (also referred to as a &quot;dump&quot;). Aside from being scattered on separate floors and a bell boy who couldn't comprehend the idea of &quot;clean shirts&quot;, the Lads braved it all and focused on the job at hand. 

The Lads were innovative in their song selection and introduced several new songs to the society. In the quarter-finals they sang two unique numbers: ''Ro-Ro-Rollin' Along'', borrowed from the Sweet Adelines [[The Big Four|Big Four]] quartet and rearranged by Floyd Connett, and Hal Staab's arrangement ''There’s a Rose on Your Cheek''. 

In the semi-finals they sang ''My Indiana Home'', and ''Love Me and The World Is Mine'' which became a hit and was repeated by many of those who were in the contest audience when they returned to their home chapters. The Lads credited [[Frank Thorne]] with the song but later Frank asked THEM for the arrangement. 

The scores allowed the [[Gaynotes]] and the Lads to make the finals but the luck of the draw placed the Gaynotes singing first and the Lads last in the contest. They sang ''Way Down in Georgia'' and closed the contest with ''It Looks Like Rain In Cherry Blossom Lane''. The Gaynotes were third and the Lads of Enchantment were crowned 1957 International champions in only their second International contest. 

Their championship year was full of shows and wonderful memories but after being together less than four years, Don “Pistol” Pitts decided to retire from the quartet just prior to their swan song at the 1958 International in Columbus. It was the very first International quartet contest the Lads had ever SEEN. It seemed that they were almost always picked to sing last and never got to see the competition. It was a good thing too as they were very impressed with the number of outstanding quartets in the contest. They, of course, cheered on their friends the [[Gaynotes]], and were thrilled to present the trophy to another [[Southwestern District]] foursome that night. After returning home and trying a few other combinations, The Lads agreed to disband. They did temporarily reunite in time for the Mid-Winter convention of 1959 in El Paso. With alternate tenor Cal Sexton on tenor, this was final appearance. 

Unfortunately, the Lads never put out their own record album. They did have several songs and a large repertoire but like the Hearsemen, their hometown wasn't well equipped with recording studios so the task went undone. They only appear on society contest records with a few songs. They were flooded with requests for their songs, a very popular one being ''Just A Closer Walk With Thee'' they had taken off of an old recording of the Southernaires gospel quartet. 

Some of the Lads were very active in chapter and district affairs. Gil “Dad” Wallace was [[New MexiChords|Albuquerque chapter]] president at least seven times as well as a Southwestern District Area Counselor, and Vice President in two districts (Southwestern District 1967) ([[Rocky Mountain District]], several years). He also served as Rocky Mountain District Executive Vice President in 1987.  Dan served as Albuquerque's music director for many years and Carl is a past chapter secretary and president. Carl also served on the [[Southwestern District]] Board in 1957. 

In 1978 the [[New MexiChords|Albuquerque chapter]] left the Southwestern District and became a cornerstone of the new [[Rocky Mountain District]]. 

Don Pitts retired and lived in Albuquerque until his death on June 12, 1999 at the age of 71.

Gil Wallace died just last year - October 15, 2006 at the age of 84.  He is survived by his wife Dee who still lives in Winnsboro, Texas.

Danny Aycock (81) and his wife Joan live in Monroe, Louisiana where he is a field representative for the Social Security Administration.

Carlton Wright (80) lives in an assisted living facility in Ft. Oglethorpe, Georgia near his daughter, her family and his wife Dorothy.

It was nominated by CASA, the Contemporary A Cappella Society of America, for Best Album of the Year.&lt;BR&gt;
 
[http://www.nightlifequartet.com/Recordings-Blues.php/ Blues in the Night]&lt;BR&gt;
Released in 2000, this recording shows the growth in musicality of the group. You will hear many different types of songs which are all performed with that distinctive Nightlife sound!

== Extended History ==
'''Nightlife''', from Southern California, is only the second quartet in barbershop singing history to win gold medals as both international quartet champions and as members of the winning barbershop chorus on the same day! This is truly a fitting achievement for four individuals who have spent most of their lives singing and performing for others. 

Rob Menaker (tenor), John Sasine (lead), Jeff Baker (bari) and Brett Littlefield (bass) have more than 80 years of barbershop experience - something that clearly shows itself in their superb interpretation of songs and enjoyable entertainment package. 

Nightlife first got together in 1988 with Dan Jordan of [[The New Tradition]] on lead and Brian Philbin of [[Metropolis]] on bass.  They placed 2nd in the fall contest.  In 1989, Brett came on as bass, and they were 3rd that October.  John joined the quartet in the fall of 1990 (they did not compete that year) and in the fall of 1991 won the [[Far Western District]] Quartet Championship. 

In the International competitions which followed, the quartet quickly achieved success as well, winning two bronze medals and a silver. But, in July, 1996, Nightlife reached the pinnacle of success by being declared the new International Quartet Champion.

&quot;Save your Confederate money, boys, the South shall rise again!&quot; That song by the Confederates, 1956 International Champions, was to go down in history, and the quartet went on to become a true legend within the Society over the next 13 years. 

Organized at a Memphis Chapter party in September 1953, the Confederates were a popular quartet even before they won the championship. Composed of George Evans, tenor; Dave LaBonte, lead; Bill &quot;Buz&quot; Busby, bari; and Wally Singleton, bass, the foursome appeared in authentic-looking Confederate officer uniforms, complete with dress swords, or as white-haired, frock-coated Southern &quot;colonels.&quot; 

But it was the songs they sang, the arrangements they introduced, and the way they sang them that contributed even more to their fame. Chloe, Red Head, Down Where the South Begins, and A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square are only a few of the songs still identified with the Confederates. In their first International contest in 1954 they finished 31st. 

But the next year, in Miami, they leaped to second place, and in 1956 in Minneapolis they won the gold. Buz was seriously injured in an auto accident in about 1960, and the quartet laid out of the show circuit for about a year. Except for that period, however, they continued entertaining audiences throughout the country until 1969.

== Extended History ==
'''Confederates'''&lt;br /&gt;
''written and researched by Grady Kerr''&lt;br /&gt;

First organized on September 16, 1953, the boys were a product of three recently disbanded [[Memphis Men of Harmony|Memphis chapter]] quartets. It was clear from the start they would be “brothers in song”.  They blossomed quickly and were immediately popular.  

For their entire 17 year history, the foursome consisted of George Evans on tenor, Dave LaBonte singing lead, Bill &quot;Buz&quot; Busby on bari, and Wally Singleton on bass. 

George and Buz were born and bred “Rebels” while Wally was a “damnyankee” who claimed he came “clean from Pittsburgh, P. A”.  

LaBonte was a transplanted Yankee from Concord, New Hampshire.  He made it a point to tell everyone he was from the “SOUTHERN PART”.

The Confederates' trademark was striking confederate officer uniforms, complete with white gloves, hats and a dress sword.  They acted the part singing songs like ''Save Your Confederate Money Boys, the South Shall Rise Again'', ''Down Where The South Begins'' and ''Goodbye, Old Dixie, Goodbye'' 

Encouraged to enter competition, The Confederates drove 800 miles to compete for the first time.  They entered the 1954 [[Dixie District]] regional quartet prelims in St Petersburg, Florida. They did very well and qualified for the International quartet contest to be held in our nation’s capitol.

The Confederates' 1954 “Charge On Washington” only resulted in 31st place so they fell back and regrouped.

The following year they again qualified to represent the Dixie District at International. In June of ‘55 they traveled to the Miami Beach International. A year’s experience and hard work paid off. They made an unprecedented jump from 31st to 2nd place. 

Adding to their already popular southern charm they began performing in Southern &quot;Colonel&quot; outfits complete with frock coat, white gloves, string tie, and white hair including almost realistic mustache and goatee.

Thanks to their unique arrangements, success on the contest stage and their crazy onstage antics they became one of the most sought after show quartets in the Society. 

The Confederates averaged 45 shows each year. 

On June 14, 1956 they competed at the Minneapolis International and won the battle. The Confederates outscored the second place quartet by 462 points.

Buz Busby was the longtime musical director of the Memphis [[Dixie Cotton Boll|Cotton Boll Chorus]].

He and his chorus won the 1958 Int’l chorus contest. The Confederates became the first gold medal quartet to win chorus gold medals. 

The quartet continued to perform for many more years despite Busby’s serious automobile accident in 1960 and the relocation of members to Georgia and Florida.

They managed to stay together until 1969 and their official retirement from the show circuit. 

By the end they had performed in 46 States and Canada.  They shared the stage with scores of celebrities including Dinah Shore, Dick Van Dyke, Pete Fountain and Al Hirt.  

They considered singing on stage at Carnegie Hall one of their favorite highlights.

The members are no longer with us.

We lost Wally Singleton in 1971 to a heart attack.  He was 49.

Buz Busby died in 1977 after a two-year battle with a respiratory disease. He was 47.

Dave LaBonte passed away in 1990 at the age of 71 after suffering many years with Parkinson’s disease.

George Evans suffered from Alzheimer's in his later years and died June 13, 2007 at 76.

The Confederates were trend-setters and ahead of their time. Their 17 year career was a very special time in our Society’s history. We were young and still growing.  

They had a profound influence on many barbershoppers and clearly shaped the future of our style.

In fact . . . if you listen real close . . . you can hear a little “Confederates” in every great group singing today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13634">[[Image:1955Pic.jpg|right|border|Four Hearsemen]]The '''Four Hearsemen''' is the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]]'s 1955 [[International Quartet Champion]].

In 1934, members of the Blackburn-Shaw Quartet, sponsored by a funeral home in Amarillo, TX, were paid a dollar each for singing at funerals or on the firm's Sunday radio program. Tenor Wendell Heiny joined the quartet in 1935 and was soon working full-time in the funeral business. 

The quartet stayed together until World War II when three members went into the service. Heiny, along with lead Paul Ellis and bass Willard Grantham came home from the service in 1946 and started looking for a baritone. They found Dwight Elliott and in 1947 won a quartet contest sponsored by the American Legion. Two years later, Grantham dropped out of the group and was replaced by Jim Bob Nance. 

A chapter of SPEBSQSA was started in Amarillo in 1948 and the Blackburn-Shaw Quartet became members. They entered international competition in Omaha in 1950 and began receiving invitations to be on chapter shows. 

Because the name Blackburn-Shaw didn't mean anything outside of Amarillo, the four men began thinking about a name change. They incorporated a funeral director routine in their act and became the Four Hearsemen, walking on stage carrying an imaginary casket. Paul Ellis withdrew from the quartet in 1951 and Al Autrey replaced him as lead. 

In 1952 the Four Hearsemen were semifinalists at the international contest in Kansas City, but more personnel changes were in store. Autrey moved to Austin, TX and Nance entered a new business that made it impossible for him to participate. Survivors Elliott and Heiny &quot;dug up&quot; a new lead, Deane Watson, and a new bass, Dick Gifford. Nance continued to write arrangements for the quartet; he knew their voice ranges and routines. 

In 1953 the Hearsemen were second in international competition. They won the Southwestern District Championship in 1954 and the following year became international champions at the convention held in Miami, FL.

=== Four Hearsemen ===
''written and researched by Grady Kerr''&lt;br /&gt;
''taken from Golden Memories - The History of the [[Southwestern District]] - pub 1996''

In the early '30's Mr. Shaw, owner of the Blackburn-Shaw funeral home, made a trip to Dallas and heard a quartet sing for a funeral. He returned to Amarillo and organized his own. He sang lead and paid the others three dollars each for singing at funerals and on the firm's Sunday radio program singing spiritual and gospel songs. Tenor Wendell Heiny joined the quartet in 1935 and was soon working full time in the funeral business. The quartet sang together until the war sent three members into the service. 

Heiny, along with Paul Ellis, lead, and bass Willard Grantham came home from the service in 1946 and started looking for a new baritone. They found Dwight Elliott in 1947 and soon afterwards won a quartet contest sponsored by the American Legion. The prize was a free trip to New York City. Two years later, Grantham dropped out of the group and was replaced by Jim Bob Nance. 

[[Golden Spread Chorus|A chapter]] of [[SPEBSQSA]] was started in Amarillo in December 1948 and the Blackburn-Shaw quartet became members. They entered a 1950 regional contest at the last minute to give the chapter an entry and were shocked to win. It was their first real barbershop competition. They entered the International competition in Omaha in 1950, placed 32nd, and began receiving invitations to appear on chapter shows around the country.  Lubbock's veteran barbershopper Pat Cunningham insisted they change their name since Blackburn-Shaw meant nothing outside Amarillo. After much thought and no results, the idea came from singing on Tulsa's 1951 [[Parade of Quartets]] Show. Emcee Al Cashman got several laughs by introducing the quartet as: a funeral director, a life insurance salesman, a cemetery lot salesman, and a finance man (which was the truth at the time). Cashman also suggested they walk on stage carrying an imaginary casket&quot;. The stunt got so many laughs that the quartet soon added a complete &quot;Digger O'Dell&quot; routine and the new name came easy, The Four Hearsemen. 

=== Always a Bridesmaid ===

Paul Ellis withdrew from the quartet in 1951 and Al Autrey replaced him on lead. They came in second at district to the [[Dallasaires]] but went on to qualify at the regional in early 1952 for the International contest. 

In Kansas City, 1952, the Four Hearsemen were semi-finalists placing 18th, but more personnel changes were in store. Autrey moved to Austin and Nance entered a new business that made it impossible for him to participate. After a year off, survivors Elliott and Heiny &quot;dug up&quot; a new lead, Deane Watson and a new bass, Dick Gifford. Nance continued to write arrangements for the quartet. He knew their voice ranges and routines. Only a few weeks after Watson and Gifford joined the quartet, they entered the 1953 Southwestern District fall contest and again came in second.

The Four Hearsemen were very interested in what judges and coaches told them. They took notes and tried to incorporated ALL their suggestions. This might have had something to do with the results in 1954. The Hearsemen traveled to Washington, D.C. and historic Constitution Hall for the 1954 International Convention. They made the first cut (top 15) for the first time by singing ''I'm Always Chasing Rainbows'' and ''Charmaine''. In the semi-finals they did ''Got No Time'', a song the [[Garden State Quartet]] used in their win, and ''When You're A Long Long Way From Home'' (one of their most popular) and waited for the announcement of the top five. 

Four names had already been announced as they listened backstage on a small speaker with other very interested quartetters. They were expecting to hear &quot;The [[Four Chorders]]&quot; (a perennial top five quartet) to fill out the top five. They heard &quot;The Four . . .&quot; but were elated to hear &quot; Hearsemen!.&quot; The celebration was joyful but short as they had to get back to the room and select their last two songs. They really didn't plan on making it this far. 

In the finals they did what's said to be one of their very best performances. They sang ''There's Always Room at our House'' and ''I'd Love to Live in Loveland'' (as done by the [[Chordettes]]). As well as they did, it just wasn't their year . . . they again were in second place. The Hearsemen, however, were thrilled with the position and happy for their friends, The [[Orphans]], who won the contest. Breaking the habit of bridesmaids, they returned to the Southwestern District following the International and at the fall convention, they finally were crowned our District Champs. They sang ''Charmaine'' and ''When You're A Long Long Way From Home'' to edge out the other 20 entries. They were very well supported by quite a large group of fans who had been following them for many years and were thrilled to see them get the well deserved championship. 

It was a special quartet clinic in Abilene May 1, 1955 following the regional that really helped the Hearsemen. They took notes and hung on every word the judges told them. The younger quartets were impressed. Here was the current International silver medalist quartet/District Champs, qualified to be teachers themselves, still learning. 

Thanks to Johnny Means, judge's chairman, they learned how to &quot;tell the story and sell a song.&quot; This had worked for the [[Schmitt Brothers|Schmidts]] when they saw them on a Wichita Falls show. The song became the &quot;thing&quot; for The Hearsemen. When they felt empathy with their audience it gave them great satisfaction. 

The quartet and their many fans invaded Miami and like the previous contests, the Hearsemen did an outstanding job on stage and won the audience. This time, repeating three songs from the previous year, they added ''The Sunshine Of Your Smile'' to the first set and in the finals they won the judges singing, ''Georgia On My Mind'' and a ballad entitled ''Valley of the Moon''. 

Often described as having tremendously strong and smooth voices, The Hearsemen had the ability to sing 'em low with Gifford on bass. This helped set them apart in Miami. They were expected to win and they were ready to win. However, they were threatened by a young, up-and-coming quartet called the [[Confederates]].  In the end The [[Confederates]] placed 2nd and the Hearsemen finally won the gold medals. The medals were presented by their friends The [[Orphans]].

Even the joy of singing around the Old Roney Plaza Hotel in the hospitality rooms was rather difficult. It seems that just before they showed up, someone put a stink bomb&quot; in the air duct and the smell was overwhelming. They still sang and were very well received. Later that night Dwight ran into Al Shea, [[Buffalo Bills]] lead. Al requested to see the trophy which was in Dwight's room. They opened the door and the trophy was GONE! (as a joke, Dick had taken it into his adjoining room). 

=== Showtime ===

With few exceptions, the Hearsemen were &quot;on the road&quot; doing shows almost every weekend from September 1955 to May 1956. They had been active on the show circuit for many years before, but now they were traveling greater distances. Some of the highlights were the big show in Chicago with [[The Mississippi Misses]] (1954 Sweet Adeline quartet Champs) among many others.  This December 1955 stop was on the way to New York City where they appeared on a TV game show, &quot;Two For The Money&quot; where they were scheduled to be contestants (and sing a song or two). As it turned out, they won the game and $1,600. They also suggested the producers book [[The Big Four]] (Sweet Adeline quartet champs). Their appearance led [[The Big Four]] to appear as semi-regulars on the Arthur Godfrey Show. The Hearsemen were probably the championship quartet from the smallest town. Amarillo, all alone in the Texas panhandle, makes for difficult travel. The Hearsemen found themselves having to charter small planes and experiencing heroic trips in ail kinds of weather. 

One such trip was to Hartford, Connecticut. They left at 3 a.m. (planes were slower then) and got as far as New York before being stopped by a storm. So, they rented a car for the last 125 miles, had a minor accident and showed up backstage at 9 p.m. just in time to dress and sing. They did the afterglow, the after-afterglow and after being up 25 hours caught a few winks before having to drive back to New York City, catch a plane and be home around 10 p.m.. All in time for work the next morning. Quartet singing is so glamorous! 

The end of the Hearsemen was probably the 1956 International. After that Dick Gifford accepted a fine offer to work in Fort Worth for KTVT -TV. The quartet still did a few shows a year and the International conventions but nothing like the heavy schedule from the previous years. 

After the Hearsemen, Dwight and Wendell sang together in the [[Specticals]] quartet and the [[Re-Hearsemen]] placing in the top ten at district. Dwight also sang with the [[Fun-tearsmen]]. Gifford was later well known for singing in the [[Potentates]] and The [[Pitch Pirates]], winning the Southwestern District quartet crown again in 1959. 

To date The Four Hearsemen are not as well known as some. This is due to the fact that they never did a record. There just wasn't a place in Amarillo to make one so it went undone. Unfortunately, the only recordings available are a few songs released by the Society which has done little to perpetuate their legacy. However, you can still find some who are convinced that the Hearsemen were one of the best ever. And they're probably right. 

The Hearsemen were reunited August 27, 1982. They all met at Deane Watson's cabin in Cuchara, Colorado. The long weekend near the little town surrounded by beautiful mountains and lakes included hours of reminiscing and singing. In spite of the age differences (each was about five years apart) they always got along like brothers. They considered themselves very lucky to have found such good friends through song and to have had the privilege to entertain so many people while they were also having fun.

=== And Now... ===

'''Deane Watson''' was killed in an automobile accident and died 10/25/85 at the age of 63.

'''Dwight Elliot''' died 4/15/03 at the age of 86.

'''Dick Gifford''' is retired from KTVT-TV in Fort Worth as National Sales Manager in 1985 and is a long-time member of the [[Texas Millionaires|local chorus]]. 

'''Wendell Heiny''' is retired and living in Denver after many years as office manager for the Blackburn-Shaw Funeral Home and then running his own Piano Tuning business.

== Extended History ==
Marquis won the 1995 International Quartet Championship at Miami Beach representing the gold medal rich [[Johnny Appleseed District]]. They credit their win to having the right attitude. 

Each member had sung in successful quartets before and brought that experience with them to the group.
Jay previously sang with The Coalition (1977 [[Johnny Appleseed District | JAD]] Champs), The Naturals and [[Interstate Rivals]] and later won the Society’s “Music Man Quartet” championship with Great Honk.
Paul sang with Class Notes, Brand New Gang, Ricochet (1992 JAD Champs) and the [[Interstate Rivals]].
Dale sang with Uncle Sam’s Music Review, The Last National Prank, Bustin’ Loose and Ricochet.
Randy sang with The Halton County Roadshow (1980 [[Ontario District | ONT District]] Champs), Act IV ([[Johnny Appleseed District | JAD]] Champs) and The Naturals (JAD Champs and [[BHS International Quartet Medalists | 4-time Int’l Medalist]]).

Marquis won the 1994 [[Johnny Appleseed District]] championship and placed fourth in their first International together. 

They received help with selecting the right music from arrangers Don Gray, Walter Latzko, Ed Waesche, Rob Hopkins, Bill Mitchell and their primary coaches, Jim Miller and Ken Buckner.

Randy was an iconic, standout lead with a powerful voice and a master of song interpretation. He managed to hold back enough to create the perfect blend in Marquis. Originally a baritone, Jay adjusted his championship bass voice from his 1987 [[Interstate Rivals]] gold medal to blend with his new lead. Paul also had to adjust and adapt from his baritone in IR.

They managed to sing lots of shows and hold many productive rehearsals despite the fact that Randy was living in Ohio, Paul and Dale in Cincinnati and Jay in Louisville.

Marquis was also very active in the music leadership of the Cincinnati [[Southern Gateway Chorus]] and served the chapter in many ways. Paul went on to direct the chorus and led them to six appearances at Int’l with a 9th place finish in 2005.

The 1995 Marquis win completed the double gold medal effort by all four members of the 1987 [[Interstate Rivals]] adding Jay Hawkins and Paul Gilman (IR Lead Joe Connelly won his second in 1992 – IR Tenor Kipp Buckner won his second in 1993).

Marquis' first recording was “In The Wee Small Hours” followed by “Diamond Cuts”. Their most popular songs were Lulu’s Back in Town, When That Midnight Choo Choo Leaves For Alabam’, I Found A Million Dollar Baby and Randy’s special treatment of What Kind Of Fool Am I.

Sadly, Randy Chisholm died unexpectedly in August 3, 1997 from complications following a staph infection in Mid-July.

'''Orphans'''&lt;br /&gt;

&quot;We probably had the shortest reign on record,&quot; laughed Pete Tyree, baritone of the 1954 international champion quartet, the Orphans of Wichita, Kansas. But during their championship year - and especially in the 24 hours following their winning of the Landino Trophy - they may have made as many Americans aware of barbershop harmony as any quartet in history. 

On Sunday evening, June 13, 1954, they appeared on Ed Sullivan's famed Toast of the Town television show in New York City. An estimated 24 million viewers watched tenor Bud Bingham, lead Bob Groom, bass Jay Bond, and Pete Tyree. They heard Sullivan say the other performers - the dance team of Mata and Hari, Janis Paige, Johnny Rait, and Victor Borge - were applauding vigorously in the wings. 

The quartet, organized in the early 1950s, made only one change of personnel, when Pete replaced the original bari in August 1953. Although they had competed once before at the international level, they did not make the semi-finals. 

But in 1954 they zoomed from obscurity to the championship. Like all champions, the Orphans made numerous appearances during the year following their victory, but they broke up in the winter of 1955. 

Jay moved to North Carolina and then back to Wichita, where he sang with the Cavaliers. Pete went to Colorado Springs, where he directed the Pike’s Peak chapter chorus for many years and sang with a quartet called the Pusillanimous Posse. Bud and Bob also left Wichita.

== Extended History ==
'''Joker's Wild''' was formed in August of 1990 when the original four members met informally at the [[Buckeye Invitational]] in Columbus, Ohio and harmonized together. The sound and enthusiasm of the evening convinced them to form a quartet to showcase their natural blend. 

After winning the [[Johnny Appleseed District]] (JAD) Quartet Championship in October of 1990, Joker's Wild went on to represent JAD at the 1991 International contest in Louisville, Kentucky. In their first appearance on the international stage, Joker's Wild placed 10th. The next year they moved up to 5th place Bronze Medalists. In Calgary Alberta, Canada they became the 1993 2nd place silver medalists. 

And finally, in July 1994 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, they reached the ultimate goal of most barbershop quartet singers by becoming the 1994 International Champions. 

Since winning the International Championship, Steve Iannacchione (tenor), Mark Green (lead), Steve Legters (bari) and Dave Kindinger (bass) have been featured on shows and concerts throughout the world. They have entertained audiences in the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, France, and Spain. The quartet has also performed on national television, including Good Morning America, and radio spots across the United States.

'''The Vikings&lt;br /&gt;'''

Bob Lindley, baritone; Bob Maurus, tenor; Bruce Conover, lead; and Carl Stuhr, bass were all ex-service men who liked to do a little harmonizing. All four were attending Augustana College in Rock Island, IL on the GI Bill. The year was 1946. They decided to form a quartet and made their first public performance at the college the following spring. Soon they were singing for churches and PTA meetings as well as at college gatherings. 

They joined the [[Rock Island]] chapter of the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]] in 1947 and sang in their first district contest that fall, placing third. With $25 donated by the mayor, another $25 from a local radio station, and $50 from various friends, the quartet was able to attend the international convention in Buffalo in 1949. 

Bob Livesay joined the quartet as bass in 1951 when Stuhr moved out of the area and the foursome became [[Illinois District]] Champions. Livesay had sung as a high school student in Moline and was an experienced quartetter. 

The following year, the Vikings placed second in international competition. The quartet won the championship in Detroit in 1953 after having sung seven songs in competition. They were asked to sing an extra song after a hail storm falling on a metal auditorium roof made it impossible for the judges to hear the quartet. 

The Vikings made appearances at New York's Carnegie Hall, the Chicago Opera House, and Philadelphia's Academy of Music in addition to many chapter shows. At one point, the quartet had its own airplane. 

They disbanded in 1955 when Conover returned to active duty in the Air Force. Livesay later sang with Max Lauser, tenor, and Jack Moore, lead, and Maurus moving down to bari. That foursome, the [[Vi-Counts]], became [[Illinois District]] Champion in 1958 and placed in the top ten in international competition in 1959.

'''The Four Teens&lt;br /&gt;'''

The Four Teens originated in the Eau Claire, WI Chapter in September 1949. Three members - Jim Chinnock, lead; Don Lamont, baritone; and Gene Rehberg, bass, were high school students; the fourth, tenor John Steinmetz, had graduated the previous year. 

On January 8, 1950 the four young men plus a friend, Mike Egan, enlisted in the Air Force. They had decided to try to keep the quartet together and enlist as a group. The five were sent to Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio, Texas for boot camp. There, bass Gene was found to have a foot problem and was given a medical discharge. 

It looked like curtains for the quartet. They were scheduled to appear on a show built around Bob Hope and on the night before the show they found a new bass, Don Cahall from Cincinnati. They sang on the show and came to the attention of Dr. Norman Rathert, who had served as the Society's third international president in 1941. Rathert, from St. Louis, was helping one of the generals at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois stage shows for military entertainment. At Rathert's request the Four Teens were assigned to Special Services at Scott, making it possible for them to rehearse six to eight hours each day. 

The quartet entered the Central States District contest in 1951 as representatives of the St. Louis Chapter, and won. Requests began for performances on chapter shows and at other Air Force bases. In June 1952, the four were crowned Society champions in Kansas City. 

They were the second successive quartet to win its first international contest and the youngest quartet ever to reach the top spot; Chinnock was 19 and the other three were 20. As military personnel, the quartet would not ordinarily have been allowed to leave to appear on chapter shows. However, an agreement was reached between the Air Force and the Society to allow bookings on chapter and military shows, with arrangements to be handled by the quartet's &quot; business agent, bodyguard, nursemaid, and general factotum,&quot; Mike Egan. 

After their championship year, the Four Teens toured military posts throughout the world with an all-Air Force show called Tops in Blue. They also made an appearance on Arthur Godfrey's television show. All four quartet members were discharged in 1955.

'''The Gas House Gang'''

In the 1930's The St. Louis Cardinals baseball team was nicknamed &quot;The Gas House Gang&quot; to describe the players' fiery attitude toward the game and their fun-loving style of play. In 1987 a barbershop quartet from the St. Louis area chose the name to match its own personality. Since that time the energetic singing style and diverse repertoire of Kipp Buckner (tenor), Rich Knight (lead), Rob Henry (bari) and Jim Henry (bass) has proven the appropriateness of the title to people across North America and Europe. 

After winning the 1988 [[Central States District]] Competition in their first attempt, they began a steady climb up the International Competition ladder which culminated in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where they were awarded the 1993 International Quartet Championship. 

The group has performed in 48 states and have sung in such diverse locales as Russia, Hawaii, England, Ireland, Sweden, Holland, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, New York City's Carnegie Hall and The Grand Ole Opry. 

They have been seen nationwide on the PBS special, &quot;Voices in Harmony,&quot; and on NBC's Today Show. They have also been heard worldwide on BBC radio. Performers with whom they have shared the stage include such distinguished musicians as The Four Freshmen, The Swingle Singers, Rockapella, The Persuasions, The Chordettes, The King's Singers, The St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, Victor Borge, Porter Wagner, GLAD and the Grammy award winning group Chanticleer. The Gang made its theatrical debut in front of over 70,000 people as the barbershop quartet in &quot;[[The Music Man]]&quot; at The Muny, one of the world's largest outdoor theaters. 

They produced five recordings which are consistently been top sellers and were awarded nominations by the [[Contemporary A Cappella Society of America]] (CASA), including Best Barbershop Song, Studio Album of the Year, Artist of the Year, Best Christmas Album, and Best Christmas Song. 

The GHG retired in 2005 after losing their baritone Rob Henry to cancer in 2003.  

They were named to the Society's Hall of Fame in 2008

'''Schmitt Brothers'''&lt;br /&gt;

Joe, Jim, Paul, and Fran Schmitt began singing together as a quartet in September, 1949 at their mother's home in Two Rivers, WI. Two months later a local businessman and international president of the Barbershop Harmony Society, O.H. &quot;King&quot; Cole, heard them singing and invited them to visit the nearby Manitowoc chapter. 

The brothers soon became members. The quartet received a great deal of help from two men in the chapter. Milt Detgen, the chorus director, arranged many of their songs and John Means, later to become president of the Society, became one of their coaches. In 1950 the quartet became Land O' Lakes District champion. The brothers had made only about five public performances at the time. 

While preparing for the international preliminary contest the following spring, they met Rudy Hart, another man who assisted them for many years as coach and arranger. Selected as one of four quartets to represent the district at the international contest in Toledo, the Schmitts began rehearsing at least once each day, met with Means three days per week, and learned two more songs. 

In the semifinal contest round they sang in last position and earned a standing ovation. They won the international contest and the hearts of the audience. 

Being a new quartet, they were in need of a repertoire. They went home and learned 20 songs before their first barbershop show in September. During their championship year the Schmitt Brothers sang 110 performances including the Ed Sullivan network television show and the Arthur Godfrey show. 

In 1952 they made a two-week USO tour of military installations in Alaska. 

In 1956 the Schmitts were featured in a color filmstrip explaining the Voice Expression judging category, produced by the Society. The production received an award as the best instructional film of the year. 

Each year the quartet sang on a show produced by the Society's Association of International Champions (AIC). 

At the 1966 convention in Chicago the four brothers rented a bus and loaded their wives and 32 children aboard. All 40 of them appeared on stage at the AIC show. 

The quartet became active as teachers at district and international schools and clinics. In 1980 the Schmitts received an award from the Wisconsin Music Educator's Conference for outstanding service to school music. 

The Schmitt Brothers from Two Rivers entertained barbershop audiences for 34 years, traveling more than two million miles and appearing on nearly 3,000 shows.

== Extended History ==
Keepsake of Polk County, Orlando and Winter Park, Florida won the gold in 1992 in New Orleans 

Keepsake was a quartet with the ability to reach across the footlights and grabs the hearts of the audience with their music. Their expressive song selection included charts written and arranged by [[Lou Perry]], Renee Craig, Bob Disney, Greg Volk and [[Clay Hine]]. Roses of Picardy was a popular choice during their winning year and considered as the unofficial song of the contest in the Superdome. They reached the top with the help of top coaches like [[Larry Ajer]], Jim Casey, Dave LaBar and Paul Gallagher. 

They were a popular quartet and booked on many chapter shows across the country as well as travels to Italy and the French Riviera. They produced [[#Recordings | three fine recordings]], The Entertainer, Once Upon A Time and Without A Song.

Roger Ross started singing barbershop at age 10 in Terre Haute, Indiana. After relocating to Florida in 1972, he sang in his first quartet on baritone with his dad in the quartet Elements of Harmony, then Center of Attraction (1980, with brother, Rusty).  This was Roger’s first taste of the International contest stage and subsequently made nine more trips to the Int’l stage singing three different parts and with several quartets who also won the Sunshine District quartet championship: Popular Choice (1982-tenor), Cheerful Noise (1985-lead) and One Shot Deal (1988-lead, w/ Tony De Rosa) and Keepsake (1991-tenor). Roger is one of three members to have won FOUR Sunshine District Championships. The others were Sean Mulligan (5) and Tony De Rosa (4).

Roger was also director of Orlando’s Orange Blossom Chorus. He later led Winter Park’s [[Sunshine Jubilee Chorus]] to a district championship in 1988 and directed the Tampa Bay [[Heralds of Harmony]] in International competition in Salt Lake City in 2004. He has been a permanent “sub” with the famous [[Dapper Dans of Disney World]] since 1978, is former Dean of Sunshine Sizzle [[HEP school]], was SUN District [[Barbershopper of the Year]] in 1987, is a SUN HOF inductee and served as President of the [[Association of International Champions]] (AIC). He, along with Tony DeRosa, currently sings tenor with the quartet [[Main Street]] with whom they both earned international fifth place medals in 2011.

This was Joe Connelly’s second of three gold medals. At the age of 13, young Joe wasn’t yet awesome but joined the [[Southern Gateway Chorus | Southern Gateway]] Cincinnati chapter and learned at the knee of his dad (Mike – bari of the Roaring 20’s). He won gold in 1987 with [[Interstate Rivals]]. “Awesome Joe” moved to Florida and directing the Orlando [[Orange Blossom Chorus]] to a repeat district championship in 1989.  A certified Interpretation judge, Joe also served on the [[Harmony College]] Faculty many years.

He has been an active and popular coach of men’s and women’s quartets and choruses. One of his quartets was [[Showtime]] (1993 International Queens of Harmony).  Three weeks after winning his gold in New Orleans, Joe married Showtime’s outstanding lead, Debbie. He continued his quest for gold with [[Old School]] having placed 5th at International in 2008 on their first attempt. Old School eventually went on to win in 2011, making Joe the first four-time international gold medalist in the society.

Don Barnick is the only two-time gold medalist to win on both tenor and bass. In seventh grade he got hooked on barbershop and formed his first foursome, The Tuneagers. At 18 he began directing the [[Sweet Adelines International | SAI]] Lake Erie Seaway (SAI) and later directed the Lakewood Gold Coast Choruses. In 1973 he moved to Florida and sang in Brush and Lather 4, American Tradition and Phase IV quartets. Don also sang with the Orange Blossom Chorus and the Tin Types quartet (with Dick Kneeland at that time, a Dapper Dans' Lead singer, Bill Wood, and Chuck Pritchett).

Barnick moved to Chicago and joined the [[Grandma's Boys]] who won gold in 1979. They retired in 1985 and he moved back to Florida and sang baritone with SideKicks placing top ten three times at International.  Don is also a three-part sub for the [[Dapper Dans of Disney World]] and sings in a fun quartet with his wife Ellen called 3 Flirts and a Skirt.

This win made Tony De Rosa (19) the youngest member to win the gold. Tony grew up in a barbershop family and started at the age of 7 with his dad, Joe, director of the [[Chorus of the Genesee]] in Rochester, New York. In 1981 they moved to Florida where Papa Joe directed the Pride of the Polk chorus. The family is total barbershop with Mom, a [[Harmony, Inc.]] Champion (1979) and sister, Chris, singing with Toast of Tampa [[Sweet Adelines International | Sweet Ads]]. Tony started singing with a quartet at age 10 with Cypress Chord Club, 1984 district champion and 1985 International competitor. He joined Roger in One Shot Deal. He went on to win with [[PLATINUM]] in 2000 and [[Max Q]] in 2007. He currently sings lead with Main Street who earned an international fifth place bronze medal in 2011.

== Extended History ==
In 1945 a quartet called the [[Barber Shop Four]] had a radio program that aired every Sunday at 12:45 in Buffalo, NY. Al Shea sang lead; the other quartet members were Bill Delfield, tenor; Ross Davis, bari; and Ralph Bone, bass. The group made many appearances at USO shows and war bond drives in the area. Two years later, Shea and baritone Hershel Smith were ready to start a new quartet. They invited tenor Vern Reed and bass Bill Spangenberg to Smith's house to do some singing. Reed and Spangenberg were not Society members at the time. 

As an unnamed foursome they began singing for community groups. During an appearance at the Buffalo Quarterback Club they were introduced as the Buffalo Bills and the name stuck. 

The quartet had an inauspicious beginning in international competition, placing 16th at Oklahoma City in 1948. However, they became district champions that fall and moved up to sixth place the following year. At that point Smith left the quartet and was replaced by Dick Grapes. 

In Omaha in 1950 the gold medals were hung around their necks and a new era of barbershop harmony began. There was something different about the Buffalo Bills; their big sound, combined with the work of Phil Embury and other talented arrangers, kept them busy singing on barbershop shows and gave them a popularity no other Society quartet had achieved. 

The Society's [[Armed Forces Collaboration Program]] brought requests for them to sing before military audiences. Soon they were touring military posts in Germany, France, Austria, Japan, Korea, and other far-flung places. 

In 1957 a famous conductor and radio personality, [[Meredith Willson]], wrote a stage musical about his home town of Mason City, Iowa. His plot included a quartet. Willson had heard the Bills' records and suggested they come to New York and audition for the role of the Iowa quartet. 

They were immediately accepted but joining the musical meant leaving their jobs and moving to New York City. Dick Grapes decided to stay behind and Wayne &quot;Scotty&quot; Ward, former tenor of the international finalist [[Great Scots]] quartet of Steubenville, Ohio joined them for the adventure. The move to New York brought them television and radio appearances, including the Arthur Godfrey show, where they met [[Walter Latzko]], a CBS staff music arranger. Latzko, who later became well-known throughout the Society, provided much of the quartet's show material during the next ten years. 

[[The Music Man]] was a great success and ran for many years on Broadway. A motion picture was made, featuring the Bills in the same roles. In 1962, after filming was completed, illness forced Bill Spangenberg to leave the quartet. He died the following year. Spangenberg was replaced by another Ohioan, Jim Jones, bass of the [[Sta-Laters]], [[Johnny Appleseed District]] champs. The quartet made personal appearances for another five years and were featured on almost every kind of stage. They continued to sing on the Arthur Godfrey radio program. 

When the final curtain rang down on the Buffalo Bills, they left behind a record that may never be topped in the world of barbershopping - 1,510 performances on Broadway, 728 concerts, 675 radio shows, 672 night club and hotel appearances, 626 conventions, 216 television shows, 137 state fair performances, and a major motion picture. Their fifteen record albums are another permanent record of their great singing. 

The Buffalo Bills sang their last show at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York on May 24, 1967.

== Extended History ==
Four employees at the Bell &amp; Howell Company, lead Marty Mendro, baritone Forrest Haynes, bass Bob Corbett, and tenor George Kledzik, formed a quartet. Bob Rodriguez replaced George as tenor when the other three members left Bell &amp; Howell, and the group changed its name to the Mid-States Four. The president of the Mid States Insurance Company had taken an interest in the quartet and offered to sponsor them, providing uniforms and expenses in return for jobs done for his firm if they would use the corporate name. 

Haynes had been a member of a quartet that was one of the last to appear on the Keith road show circuit on stage and radio. 

Mendro, a soloist in church choirs during his younger years, was introduced to barbershop harmony at Bell &amp; Howell during World War II. The foursome became 6th place international finalists in 1945 and 1946 and were [[Illinois District]] champions in 1946. 

Art Gracey, formerly with the [[Fort Dearborn Four]] of Illinois, joined the quartet replacing Corbett, who was forced to give up singing with the group due to the pressure of business obligations. 

The quartet finished third at the international contest in Milwaukee in 1947 with Bob Rodriguez singing tenor. Rodriguez, later known as Bob Mack, had studied voice in Chicago. 

The Mid-States Four were second at Oklahoma City in 1948 and became the Society's eleventh quartet champion in Buffalo in 1949. 

The quartet became famous for its ability to combine smooth styling of currently popular songs with madcap comedy and serious barbershop ballads. They were featured on barbershop chapter shows throughout the United States and Canada and appeared with many big-name entertainers on commercial shows. 

In 1950, during the Korean conflict, the Mid-States Four traveled more than 24,000 miles, doing a total of 33 shows for more than 52,000 United Nations troops. Their schedule took them to the front lines as well as to recreational areas and hospitals in Korea and Japan. 

They left the show circuit around 1966 but came out of retirement in 1982 with Phil Hansen replacing Art Gracey who had died. They performed in the [[Association of International Champions]] show at the 1983 international convention in Seattle. Hansen came from a singing family and was a veteran of several quartets, among them the Memories and Madness Quartet. 

Tenor Bob Mack died in the spring of 1988. The quartet made a cameo appearance on the golden anniversary Association of International Champions show with Don Barnick of the 1979 Champion [[Grandma's Boys]] and 1992 Champion [[Keepsake]] filling in as tenor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3259">[[Image:1948Pic.jpg|right|border|Pittsburghers]]The '''Pittsburghers''' is the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]]'s 1948 [[International Quartet Champion]].

Anthony &quot;Zebo&quot; DiPerro first instilled a love for barbershop harmony in Tom Palamone. The two were part of a quartet that rattled the walls in the back room of Zebo's Pittsburgh grocery store in 1938. Palamone sang lead, Harry &quot;Chummy&quot; Conte was tenor, Zebo sang baritone, and &quot;Turp&quot; Marcanello was the bass. Zebo knew hundreds of songs and quite a few parodies that he taught the quartet. 

They never used a pitchpipe; the lead would hang out a note and off the quartet would go, woodshedding the harmony. 

In 1946 the quartet, then known as the Allen Club Four, went downtown to the Fort Pitt Hotel and joined the Pittsburgh Chapter of SPEBSQSA. The quartet attracted the attention of Maurice &quot;Molly&quot; Reagan, founder of the chapter, who was an accomplished arranger of quartet music. 

After a month under Reagan's coaching, the Allen Club Four decided to take a shot at the 1946 international quartet competition in Cleveland, Ohio. They placed a respectable sixth. 

Zebo sang with the group a few months more, then the demands of his business compelled him to reluctantly part from the quartet. He was replaced by John &quot;Jiggs&quot; Ward who had sung bari with Bob Holbrook, lead of the 1941 champion Chord Busters, in the Serenaders quartet in the 5th Marine Corps Division during the final years of World War II. 

Bill Conway took over the bass spot when Marcanello left Pittsburgh to sing with a band in New Jersey. Eighteen months later, still under the tutelage of Reagan, the quartet, renamed the Pittsburghers, won the gold medal at the 1948 international competition in Oklahoma City. 

The quartet continued singing for three more decades and underwent a number of personnel changes. In 1955 Tom O'Malley moved into the lead spot and Palamone moved up to tenor when Conte dropped out. O'Malley had sung lead in the 1952 Johnny Appleseed District Champion Four Maldehydes. By the end of the decade, Conway was replaced by Dutch Miller at bass. In 1963, Nick Kason, who had sung with the Selectones, took over the bass part. 

Two years later, the name Pittsburghers was retired when Jiggs Ward decided to withdraw, leaving Palamone as the only remaining member of the championship foursome. With Jack Elder, formerly of the Town and Country Four, singing bari, the group continued to do show dates as the Pittsburgh Four. 

The Pittsburgh Four was active until the 1980's when Tom O'Malley died.

== Extended History ==
''written and researched by Grady Kerr''&lt;br /&gt;
''adapted from Golden Memories - The History of the Southwestern District - pub 1996''

This &quot;Cinderella story&quot; is unique and interesting when one considers what they accomplished in such a short amount of time. These guys can boast of winning the International quartet championship just six months after first singing together. There is, however, a Paul Harvey-like &quot;rest of the story&quot;. 


==== Family Tree ====
You have to trace their family tree back to a quartet called the [[Class of the '80s]]. Through several personnel changes the originals were Greg Clancy, Dan Bell, David Kenner, and Mike Tolley) the 80's finally consisted of Greg Clancy on tenor, Dan Bell on lead, Jason January on bari and Todd Wilson on bass. They were a very popular show quartet with many innovative arrangements and even sang a few songs with accompaniment. 

In 1987 Class of the 80's did a huge show of their own, selling out the Majestic Theater with the Dallas Jazz Orchestra and the [[Rich-Tone Chorus|Rich-Tones]]. Their influence and devotion to the Four Freshmen was evident that night with their performance of Freshmen original charts. 

When gold medalist Jeff Oxley moved to Dallas in 1986 they all became fast friends. Jeff spent time coaching the quartet. Greg decided to quit and join the reunited [[Dealer's Choice]] in the fall of 1988 so Todd moved to tenor and Jeff stepped in to fulfill the last scheduled performances. As the 80's came to an end, so did the quartet with Dan Bell deciding to retire from the quartet.  The multiple combinations had lasted ten years, produced two recordings and won the 1987 [[Southwestern District]] [[SWD Quartet Champions | quartet championship]]. 

In December of 1989, Jeff, Todd and Jason auditioned Rick Middaugh (lead of the Yankees) for a new quartet geared toward competition. With just minor adjustments the foursome created some awesome sounds that convinced them that this was going to be something special. They continued to rehearse but kept a low profile. 

The Class of the 80's made their final appearance at the January 12, 1990 [[Vocal Majority]] installation banquet where Dan announced his retirement. The new quartet (still to be named) then sang and were very well received. 

On February 17, 1990 they took part in a new society program called &quot;Top Gun&quot; with the Southwestern District bringing in top notch coaches and inviting some of the Southwestern District's top quartets to a weekend of intense instruction. The coaches participating were Steve Plumb, [[Larry Ajer]], Darryl Flynn, and Don Clause.

The seminar was a huge success and this new quartet was the hit of the weekend. This unique new sound needed a unique new name and Acoustix&quot; was chosen just before prelims. The impact they made was reminiscent of the [[Dealer's Choice]] when they first sang. Everyone knew this quartet had great potential. 

Top notch quartets attract top notch support. Armed with new arrangements from [[Ed Waesche]], more advice from Clause and Ajer, and new fans cheering them on, Acoustix won prelims and began preparing for their first International (the previous year Class of the 80's had come in 14th). 


==== Veteran Barbershoppers ====
All were already veteran barbershoppers and musicians. 

Oxley, came from Ohio and Bowling Green State University. He had sung in several operas with the Michigan Opera Theater. He joined the Society in 1980 and won the gold with his first quartet, [[The Rapscallions]] (1984). 

Jason January joined the Dallas Town North chapter at the young age of 16 and by 19 was singing with the VM. He'd been ban section leader and an active member of the music staff for many years. Jason had also been a member of the New Orleans chapter while attending Tulane for a short time. He won his first Southwestern District quartet championship with Gatsby four years before winning with Class of the 80's.   

Rick Middaugh (pronounced &quot;Mid Awe&quot;) came from Ohio where his grandfather was an active quartet man in the 40's with the &quot;Song Peddlers&quot;. Rick's dad was also a Society member and sang with the Limelighters. Rick had no choice but to join the Society when he was 15 and sing with his dad in &quot;Status Symbol&quot;. Rick won the [[Johnny Appleseed District]] [[JAD Quartet Champions | quartet championship]] in 1982 with New Regime. He joined the Dallas Town North chapter. 

Todd Wilson's barbershop family tree is well known. A 25-year member of the Society, he grew up hearing [[The Suntones]] rehearse in his living room as his dad, Harlan, was the baritone. On moving to Dallas in 1982, Todd joined the VM and has been tenor section leader for many years. 


==== The Contest ====
Acoustix showed up in San Francisco an unknown, but soon talk of &quot;here's one to watch&quot; was heard. By the time they had finished the first set wearing their &quot;dress-white military uniforms&quot; and singing their WWI Medley and So Long, Mother, rumor of an upset was spreading fast. 

In the semi-finals they did their Irish set with Four Leaf Clover and Irish Lullaby. It had been 17 years since anyone had won on their first time out so such a miracle wasn’t even being contemplated by the spectators (with a few Southwestern District exceptions).
 
The quartet was actually in fourth place going into the finals but they had saved their best, and least rehearsed set, for last. Singing When It Comes to Lovin' the Girls Medley and I'm Afraid the Masquerade is Over they racking up the highest set scores by any quartet that week and leaped over the others taking the gold from sentimental favorites [[139th Street Quartet]] by a slim 20 points. 

The announcement and trophy presentation was emotional for the quartet as well as their fans. Jeff became the 10th and youngest society member to win a second gold medal. Rick became the first member of the Dallas Town North chapter to win and Todd became the first second-generation gold medalist. They were also the third championship quartet from the Dallas Metro chapter (The DC had also won on their first attempt). Of the seven first time winners, four were now from the Southwestern District. The only drawback of winning in 1990 was they never won the Southwestern District quartet contest. Although they are still eligible to compete on that level, they are in good company. The [[Confederates]] never won their district either. 

This near-impossible feat of winning the first time out was accomplished with hard work and talent but since that time, Acoustix have been busy getting better and setting new standards. Their sound is truly unique - the lead/bass match is ideal for expanded sound and this quartet has the experience and skill to take advantage of that match. 


==== Life After Gold ====
It's only natural that everyone wants to hear them and have them entertain their local barbershop patrons. Acoustix have kept up a rigorous schedule of performances averaging about 75 concerts a year. (As of 1996) they have sung in 37 states, four Canadian provinces, Great Britain, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Germany and Saudi Arabia. (win the gold, see the world!)
 
They've performed on national TV and radio (NBC, ABC, PBS), for several celebrities (Peter Jennings, Texas Governor George Bush, Charlton Heston), shared the stage with Mitch Miller, Isaac Stern, the Gatlin Brothers and opened sporting events for the Texas Rangers, the Dallas Mavericks, Dallas Stars, Dallas Sidekicks, Dallas Texans, SMU football and basketball and even the Houston Oilers, Detroit Lions and the San Francisco 49ers. They're even heard daily on Armed Forces Radio and Television and the Far East Network. 

All total, Acoustix have sung for 60 Society chapters, 20 Sweet Adelines chapters totaling over 400 performances since 1990 (that's roughly over 700 thousand people). 

Their most treasured performance came on April 16, 1994 when they appeared on stage at Carnegie Hall. It had been a long road for four young men who just liked to sing. 

Acoustix has a combined Society membership of over 80 years.

== Extended History ==
Second Edition (of Louisville, Kentucky) won the 1989 International Competition held in Kansas City.
They had been singing together since 1986 and one of the youngest quartets to win with the oldest only 25.

The Second Edition can actually be considered a second version of The [[Harrington Brothers]] (David, Doug, Jamie Meyer and Allen Hatton of the 1978 champions [[Bluegrass Student Union]]). After they disbanded, David, Doug and Jamie found tenor Fred Farrell in December of 1986. 

Second Edition placed second in their first Int’l at Hartford ‘87 and repeated as silver medalist in 1988 in San Antonio.

David started singing barbershop at age 11 encouraged by his mother Lois and grandmother Lee.

Doug was the youngest of the Harrington Brothers (w/Mike, Jeff and David) and grew up singing on stage. They were members of the Columbus Ohio [[Singing Buckeyes]] and joined when Doug was only 10 years old. In 1984 the Harringtons were the [[BHS International Quartet Medalists | youngest quartet to win a medal at Int’l]].

In middle school, Jamie formed his first quartet called the Derby City Four. They sang for a Louisville [[Thoroughbreds]] rehearsal and were very well received and encouraged. He joined them in 1982. He also sang with the Men of Accord and Class of ’84 quartets.

Fred began in Iowa with the Happiness Express Chorus of the Denison, IA chapter thanks to his dad, Don (founder and director) and his mother, Katie, [[SAI | Sweet Adeline]], arranger and songwriter. There Fred sang in a quartet named The Iowa Supreme Chord. After a move to Chicago and joining the West Town Chapter he joined a pick-up quartet with Ken Jordahl (Four Henchmen), [[Buzz Haeger|Warren &quot;Buzz&quot; Haeger]] ([[Four Renegades]]) and Dick Kingdon ([[Chiefs of Staff]]). They placed second at the [[Illinois District]] fall contest almost winning the championship.

Second Edition traveled extensively appearing on shows in 30 states as well as England, Scandinavia and New Zealand. They were often booked on shows with their [[SAI | Sweet Adeline]] counterparts, the 1989 champion, Growing Girls, of Sweden. This spawned some successful relationships professionally and personally. As it turned out the bass of Second Edition (Jamie) married the bass of Growing Girls (Naima) and the baritone of Second Edition (Doug) married to the lead of Growing Girls (Suzanne). Both couples now live in Sweden. 

SE produced [[#Recordings | only one LP]] entitled Second Edition I.  It is a ground breaking recording and reflective of the monster talent of these four young men. The quartet didn’t stay together long after winning without making a second recording. They retired in the mid 90s.

All SE members are still active in barbershopping. David sang in other quartets like A Few Good Men and continues to arrange music for quartets and choruses. Fred has returned recently to sing with [[Crossroads]] that includes three other past champs, Mike Slamka, lead - Brandon Guyton, bari - Jim Henry, bass). They placed 2nd in 2008 and won the International Quartet Championship in 2009.

Doug coaches various top music groups around the world such as The Real Group and Vocal Six. He is also the director and founder of a new chorus called [[SNOBS | zero8]] with several talented, young and energetic singers in Stockholm, Sweden. They qualified for the 2009 International Chorus contest to be held in Anaheim, California. Also now singing with zero8 is a tried and true bass named Jamie Meyer.

== Extended History ==
The Chiefs of Staff won the championship on July 4th of 1988 in San Antonio during the Society’s 50th anniversary convention. They were the last recipients of the original [[Ben Landino Quartet Champion trophy|International Quartet (Landino) Trophy]].

It began during a picnic in the fall of 1983. Don Bagley got the quartet bug again during the Seattle Int’l and approached Chuck Sisson. They found southside Irishman tenor Tim McShane was available and then sang a few tags with lead, soon to be bari, Dick Kingdon in the Illinois District hospitality room at the 1984 St Louis Int’l.  The foursome was set.

They decided that the sound was pretty good and stage presence help was needed. They worked with George Gipp ([[Cincinnati Kids]] and [[Chicago Chord of Trade]]). They also enlisted the help of sound and interpretation coaches, Jay Giallombardo and Ken Buckner and used the top arrangers of the day, [[David Wright]], [[Greg Lyne]] and [[Buzz Haeger|Warren &quot;Buzz&quot; Haeger]]. Musically the foundation was strong.

Non-singing mic time was assigned to Don, a natural storyteller. They worked on sharing the emotions of the song with their audience and succeeded adding to their popularity as a top quartet.

The Chiefs won the 1984 [[Illinois District]] Championship and moved up the ladder at the International quartet competition. 12th in 1985, 5th in 1986, 3rd in 1987 and finally FIRST in ’88.

Bass Don Bagley was a member of the Arlington Heights, ILL [[Arlingtones]] chapter. He started singing barbershop in 1961 while in the [[Northeastern District]] in quartets such as The B-Sharps.

He and his wife, CarolAnn, were a perfect “barbershop couple”. They met in 1966 at the Int’l convention there while Don was stationed in the Army in San Antonio and directing the Chordsman Chorus. She was from Oklahoma and working for the [[Sweet Adelines International]] Headquarters in Tulsa. 

Don was in two other top quartets, [[Soundtracks]] (1971) and [[Tin Pan Allies]] (1981) who were both ILL district champs. He won his first medal (5th) with the Soundtracks in 1974.

CarolAnn sang lead with [[Jubilation]] in 1985 to win the Sweet Adeline Crown beating him to the championship by three years. They are only the third husband and wife couple to win both organization’s top honor.

Don has also served as president of the Association of Int’l Champs ([[AIC]]). He and CarolAnn now live in Florida.

Lead Chuck Sisson joined the Society in 1982 and came to barbershop as a church choir, folk trio, gospel trio singer with musical theatre experience. He starred his senior year of high school as Billy Bigelow in Carousel. Within weeks of joining the Arlingtones he was in a quartet called Four on the Floor. His strong voice and heartfelt presentations as lead were major contributing factor to the big sound of this quartet. Chuck still lives in the Chicago area and has worked in local theatre in recent years. As successful graphic designer, Chuck designed the new quartet trophy (the Hugh Ingram Trophy) that was presented the champs the following year.

Tenor Tim McShane is a native Chicagoan, was president of his HS glee-club and member of the All-City Choir. He formed his first quartet after seeing The Music Man on TV.  In 1970 he joined the Southwest Suburban / Oaklawn chapter His first Society quartet, The Melody Four had only been together a year when they auditioned for a production of The Music Man – they got the part. Prior to the Chiefs he sang with Soundfitters Union (1976) and Daily Favorites (1983) and placed in the finals of the ILL district contests.

Bari Dick Kingdon hailed from South Dakota and recalls lots of singing at family gatherings not realizing the harmonizing was based on barbershopping. He started, as most, in high school and church choirs and glee clubs. He joined the Society in 1976 (Lombard) and was an international semi-finalist with Friends in 1980, 1981 and 1982. He sang LEAD with the 1987 International Chorus Champion [[West Towns Chorus|West Towns]] and served as their lead section leader although he sang bari with the Chiefs. He’s now singing with a senior quartet, Take Note.

The produced [[#Recordings | three LPs]] Tribute, Solid Gold and Memories. They were best know for their renditions of Sam The Accordion Man, Ma, She’s Makin’ Eyes At Me, Brother Can You Spare a Dime, It’s a Great Day For the Irish (from their ground-breaking Leprechaun set at Int’l) Kiss Me One More Time, Lonesome That's All and What Kind of Fool Am I?

The Garden State Quartet came to life in 1941. Jimmy Verdick, bari, and Ted Rau, tenor, worked together at Western Electric. Jim knew a lead singer named Bob Freeland in Newark and the three of them met at Ted's house in Jersey City with Joe Marrese, bass. 

These four sang together for about a year, then Verdick enlisted in the Navy. The search for a fourth part began and in May of 1943, the trio found Jack Briody, who had recently been discharged from the Army. Rau was a former nightclub entertainer and Freeland had been a member of a tumbling and singing act in vaudeville during the 1920s. He had also appeared in Irving Berlin's Broadway show, Yip, Yip, Yaphank. Briody had sung on the radio and in nightclubs with the Garden State Trio and Marrese was a glee club baritone until he began singing with the quartet. 

The quartet became New Jersey State champion in 1943 and 1944. They entered international competition in 1944 wearing bathing suits and finished in fifth place. 

They dropped down to finalist ranking in 1945 but, with hard work, were able to take the championship at the convention in Cleveland in June, 1946.

Art Bielan, lead, Joe Murrin, tenor, and E.V. &quot;Cy&quot; Perkins, bari, formed three legs of a quartet on a train en route to the national SPEBSQSA convention in July 1941. They shanghaied Pete Buckley to sing bass. All were members of the Chicago No. 1 Chapter. Lacking a name and a costume, they exchanged coats and christened themselves the Misfits. They placed seventh. 

Tenor Joe &quot;Moose&quot; Murrin had sung in a quartet while in the Navy during World War I and he sang with the Chicago Police Octet for nine years. Art Bielan, lead, had sung with a number of quartets, including the Suberpa Four, the State Four, and the Forges Post quartet, the latter group being an American Legion foursome. Cy &quot;You're Wrong&quot; Perkins, who had sung baritone for a quarter century, was happy to point out other fellows' mistakes, thereby endearing himself to many barbershoppers. Pete &quot;Butch&quot; Buckley had previously contributed his resonant bass voice to the P&amp;O Quartet and the Variety Four. 

The Misfits placed fifth at the national contest in 1942, and did not compete the following year due to the absence of Buckley, who spent nine months in Mississippi helping Uncle Sam build ships, but in 1944 the group finished in second place. 

To comply with regulations of the War Committee on Conventions, the preliminary round of competition in 1945 was held in four different cities: New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City. 

The top fifteen quartets then competed in the final round at the Detroit Masonic Auditorium in June where the Misfits won top ranking.

== Extended History ==
The original four members of '''Interstate Rivals''' - Kipp Buckner, Joe Connelly, Geoff Mucha, and Jay Hawkins - were all second-generation barbershoppers. Paul Gilman, who replaced Geoff as baritone in 1986, had been introduced to barbershopping by his uncle in 1980. 

Geoff and Joe, members of Cincinnati's [[Southern Gateway Chorus]] teamed up with Kipp and Jay, members of the Louisville [[Thoroughbreds]], in 1982. In 1983, the foursome finished in the top ten at their first international contest. 

They placed sixth in 1984, third in '85, and moved to second in 1986. That year, Geoff's postal service promotion forced him to move to another city. The remaining three drafted Paul from Cincinnati, and he had the rare thrill of winning a gold medal in his first international contest in 1987 at Hartford, Conn. 

Despite their youth (they were the second youngest quartet ever to win the championship at the time), the original Rivals combined 45 years of barbershop experience. Kipp's father had sung in an international finalist quartet, Joe's dad was an international quartet medalist, Geoff's father had directed choruses to two bronze medals, and Jay's father had sung for many years in Dayton, Ohio's chorus. 

The Rivals are the only quartet to have all 4 members go on to claim other quartet championship, Joe with [[Keepsake]] in 1992, [[PLATINUM]] in 2000, and [[Old School]] in 2011, Kipp with [[Gas House Gang]] in 1993 and [[Old School]] in 2011, and Jay and Paul with [[Marquis]] in 1995.

The Harmony Halls came from a background of quartet singing that dated back two generations. Grandpa Hall sang bass in a quartet during Abraham Lincoln's presidency. Pop Hall, his son, was a choir and quartet singer at the turn of the century and when O. C. Cash founded the Society it was only natural that some of the six Hall brothers would become barbershoppers. 

Harold, Ray, and Gordon Hall, singing lead, bari, and bass respectively, formed the Hall Brothers quartet with tenor John &quot;Slim&quot; Peterson. At the 1942 national contest in Grand Rapids, the quartet made the finals with Frank Clark as tenor. 

In March of 1943 the quartet was reorganized; Ray, who was known among barbershoppers as &quot;Curley&quot;, and Gordon Hall sang with Bob Hazenberg, lead, and Ed Gaikema, tenor. That year, the Harmony Halls placed fifth. During a year of intensive work, they became Michigan champions the following spring, then entered the international contest in Detroit and won first place.

The Four Harmonizers, a Chicago quartet, competed in the 1941 and 1942 national contests and finished just out of the medalist class. They were considered a top-flight foursome, composed of Charles Schwab, tenor; Leo Ives, lead; Ed Young, baritone; and Fred Stein, bass. 

In March 1943, just a few months before the Chicago contest at which they won the national championship, a new baritone, Huck Sinclair joined the group. Sinclair had grown up in a harmonious family. His mother sang lead, his sisters took the tenor and bari parts, and Huck sang bass. He had sung in quartets in high school and college and, before joining the Four Harmonizers, he was a member of the Capital City Four of Topeka, Kansas. 

Bass Fred Stein began singing at the age of three and he won a prize as the best alto of his eighth grade class. He began singing in quartets at the age of seventeen and for eight years toured the vaudeville circuit with the Troy Comedy 4 and other groups. Leo Ives, lead, sang in a quartet called the Ives 4 with three of his children. Charles Schwab had sung with the Music Box Four for seven years. 

The Four Harmonizers claimed that none of the arrangements they sang were written down; all four quartet members participated in woodshedding their numbers.

== Extended History ==
When the '''Rural Route 4''' won the international quartet championship in 1986, they did not exactly qualify as an overnight sensation. 

Organized in 1971 by four residents of Cass County, Mo., the quartet would not win the gold until 15 years and two personnel changes later. Along the way were dozens of contests, from the chapter to international level, and years of hard work. But there was fun too, as the RR4 gradually built a reputation as on of the most entertaining show quartets around. 

Brothers Calvin and Willard Yoder, lead and bass respectively, and the owners of a dairy farm, plus bari Rufus Kenagy, also a farmer, and tenor Everett Roth, a carpenter, were the original members of the group. 

They qualified for their first international contest in 1976 in San Francisco, finishing in 21st place. The next eight years were a roller coaster - in the top ten three times, out of the top ten twice and laying out three years when the wives proclaimed, &quot;We're not spending this vacation at a contest!&quot; 

Meanwhile, Rufus had dropped out in 1977 and was replaced by Jim Bagby, an Associated Press newsman from Kansas City who had coached the quartet since 1972. Everett was replaced by Don Kahl, a respiratory therapist in 1983. 

Finally in 1985 at the Minneapolis convention, the RR4 earned fifth-place bronze medals. The following year, to their own surprise more than anyone else&quot;s, they jumped to the number one spot.

Roy Frisby enjoyed singing as a young man and made some extra money as a professional singer while attending high school and college. He studied voice at the Indianapolis Conservatory of Music. 

After college, Frisby worked in the development division of a bank. In 1940 one of his accounts was National Aluminum Corporation, where Frank Thorne was vice president and director. One evening in October 1941 Thorne invited Frisby, Jimmy Doyle and Herman Struble to his home for dinner. Frisby was hopeful of drumming up some bank business, but Thorne wanted him to sing in his quartet. 

The Elastic Four was organized that night in Thorne's parlor with Frisby singing lead. Struble had won scholarships at Valparaiso University and DePaul as a tenor soloist and sang with the American Opera Company for three years. Doyle was also a tenor and sang for two years with a foursome known as the Trevette Quartet. 

He then sang lead in the Old Oak Four, a traveling vaudeville quartet, before being enlisted as baritone for the Elastic Four. Thorne was an accomplished instrumental musician but enjoyed quartet singing. Once described as a lyric bass, he confessed that he did not know what that meant. He sang in the Plow City Four in Canton, IL and wrote many Elastic Four arrangements. 

The quartet rehearsed about eight hours a week in 1942 to prepare for that year's SPEBSQSA national contest in Grand Rapids, MI. Sixty quartets competed; there was no preliminary round of competition. The quartet appeared in straw hats, canes, suits, and spats; some quartets objected to their &quot;fancy attire&quot;. 

The Elastic Four were named winners and their picture appeared on the back page of the Chicago Herald - right next to a photo of a girl who had killed her grandmother.

The 1941 national champions were organized in Tulsa, OK in the spring of 1940 with Virgil Dow, tenor; Bob Holbrook, lead; Bobby Greer, baritone; and Tom Masengale, bass. The next year, Norman T. &quot;Doc&quot; Enmeier replaced Dow, who had moved to another city. 

The quartet set a goal of placing high in the SPEBSQSA national quartet contest. To meet that goal, they met on an average of four nights per week, singing from three to five hours per night. 

At the 1941 contest in St. Louis, after two afternoons of elimination, eleven quartets were selected to face the audience on the night of July 5. When the final scores were totaled, the Chord Busters were selected as national champions. 

The Chord Busters were invited to compete again in 1942 but declined. They agreed to attend the convention in Grand Rapids as non-competitors to receive recognition as champions and &quot;sing up a storm&quot; in hotel lobbies. 

They firmly established a tradition for, since that time, a quartet champion, once crowned, was never to compete again and therefore, was never to be dethroned.

'''Chord Busters'''&lt;br /&gt;
''written and researched by Grady Kerr''&lt;br /&gt;
''taken from Golden Memories - The History of the Southwestern District - pub 1996''


The Chord Busters were one of the most innovative quartets in our Society's history with several of their landmark decisions becoming standard for today's foursomes. 
The quartet consisted of Doc Enmeier as tenor, Bob Holbrook singing lead, Bobbie Greer on baritone, and Tom Masengale on bass. Since then, the tradition of crowning our champions has taken on much greater significance. 

Much of the credit for that increased respect can be given to these four men. It was in early 1940 that a joint meeting of the new barbershop quartet group and the Tulsans was held at the Hotel Tulsa. The Tulsans were a 100 voiced, nationally known, semi pro, male chorus who sang mostly classical and glee club style music. Tom, Bob, Bobbie, and tenor Virgil Dow were so impressed by the harmonies displayed by the barbershop group and a quartet called the Barflies, they formed their own quartet and joined the barbershop group. For a living, Doc became one of the leading dentists in Tulsa, Greer worked several professions (Allied Steel, The Choteha Powder Plant, Photography, Broadcast Radio, Insurance), Holbrook also worked for the powder plant as well as the City of Tulsa, and Tom would go on to retire after 44 years at Texaco. 

The name, Chord Busters was chosen and they began rehearsing in earnest. They caught the attention of many Tulsa chapter members and were encouraged to enter the upcoming Oklahoma State quartet contest where they could win and win an all expense trip to the national contest held in conjunction with the New York's World Fair. 

The Chord Busters worked up some songs and entered the state competition. In the contest they had to follow a group of policemen from Oklahoma City called the Flat Foot Four. That group would not only win this contest, but go on to win the 1940 national contest in New York. 

The &quot;Busters&quot; selected a number by Geoffrey O'Hara entitled A Little Close Harmony for one of their numbers (the intro of which is now the society's opener, The Old Songs). The arrangement and full song is non-barbershop and they were abruptly disqualified from the contest. This would be the only contest in which they would not place first. 

Soon after the contest they lost tenor Virgil Dow to love (choosing hugs over harmony). It wasn't long after that as members of the Tulsans, Tom, Bob, and Bobbie were working as ushers for a symphony concert at Skelly Stadium. Once the concert got underway, they ran into tenor Norman Enmeier in the men's room. He had also competed in a quartet at the state contest but his group broke up soon afterwards. Having four parts, they began singing. 

The sound was exciting and there was a seasoned, natural blend from the very first chord. Not deterred by the symphony goers telling them to quiet down, the Chord Busters were reborn. 

Tulsa chapter members were also impressed by the new sound and many helped. They were encouraged by Cash, Granger, O.P. Erickson, Puny Blevens, Hank Wright, Bob Chase as well as the Barflies and even the Flat Foot Four. 

One of the keys to their early success was the input of Wade Hamilton. Wade was the staff musician of radio station KTUL and organist for the Ritz Theater. His talent included being able to arrange for male voices taking advantage of individual qualities and ranges. His arrangement of I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen was their most requested song. 

At the time, most quartets didn't use ANY arrangements. They just sang it, feeling for each chord, not necessarily singing it the same way twice. These custom arrangements set the Chord Busters apart early. 

Wade was also a &quot;slave driver&quot;. The quartet credits his &quot;driving&quot; them to always work harder as a important fundamental of the quartet's accomplishments. 

The Chord Busters sang on Wade's weekly radio show in Okmulgee for 13 weeks promoting his piano course. They sang six numbers each week and went ten weeks without repeating a song. They were pressured to learn 'em fast. This discipline helped &quot;tune&quot; the quartet and also prepared them for future challenges. 

After about a year, Wade moved to California and the guys turned to another local talented musician, Lem Childers. He was a classic pianist, composer, piano teacher and lover of all kinds of music - he was also nearly totally blind. Lem studied barbershop and enjoyed the style. He agreed to teach, coach, and arrange for the quartet and picked up where Wade left off. He keep them in line, musically. 

One night Bobbie suggested they try putting bell chords in Bye Bye Blues. It took them a few months to work it out. They then sang it for Lem who put the finishing touches on it. It proved so popular, it later surfaced as a contest number for the Gaynotes in 1958, and the Suntones in 1961. 

The Chord Busters were the first quartet to &quot;get shirts alike&quot;. Although the Barflies often wore &quot;barber&quot; outfits and of course the Flat Foot Four had their uniforms, The Chord Busters felt a quartet's regular &quot;attire&quot; would add to their performance. 

Among their many outfits the most popular were their satin western shirts, each with a different solid color, and cowboy hats and boots, etc. It was very impressive and it didn't take long for other foursomes to copy the idea. 

In the year after being disqualified, the Chord Busters worked very hard. They sometimes met as many as five nights a week for up to five hours a night. The work was also lots of fun and very satisfying. 

By the time they entered the regional contest in Bartlesviile they were ready and won. Their prize? They took home twelve silver dollars (yep, that's three each). They also easily won the 1941 Oklahoma State contest that followed and as winner, received their expenses to the National Contest in St. Louis. 

Going to St Louis by train was an event. Everyone from Tulsa went and to say there was a party atmosphere would be an understatement. The press was also on hand. But the Chord Busters knew they had a job to do and were ready. Unlike today, there were five elimination rounds (of 10 quartets) with the top three quartets from each going on to the finals.
The quartet chose their songs When Irish Eyes are Smiling and a medley of Garland of Old Fashion Roses/Dear Old Girl for the first round which they won. It was customary for the 15 quartets left for the finals to sing the same songs from their previous round. The Chord Busters repeated Irish Eyes but shocked the audience by singing a new song, when The Bees Are In The Hive/Meet Me Tonight In Dreamland medley. 

There was talk that the judges (who were each scoring in all the categories) might disqualify them. Also they had followed the Kansas City Barberpole Cats who did a GREAT job. The Chord Busters saw their performance while waiting in the wings and went on NOT expecting to win. They were apparently more relaxed and might have even sung better. 
The judges chose the Barflies for third, the Barberpole Cats for second and to the delight of the large Tulsa contingency, The Chord Busters as the new World's Champions. The train trip home was full of celebrities and singers. They were the very first quartet to win on its first attempt. 

The notoriety enabled them to be one of the first quartets invited to appear on an out-of-state show. Despite travel restrictions by the war, they appeared on a show in Wichita, Kansas not long after the contest. The sell out show inspired others to risk the added expenses of booking top notch talent from around the society.
 
They didn't clown or tell jokes. . . the quartet didn't have the talent for that. Their aim was to sing as well as they could. They really enjoyed their greatest compliment when, singing in a small room, those listening admitting they could tell who was singing what part. Their unique style was copied by most of the quartets that followed. . . everyone wanted to sing like the Chord Busters, but few could. They would go on to influence the style in which all future quartets would sing. 

They averaged approximately a show a week. It's also been said that if they ever turned down a &quot;mashed potato and peas&quot; freebie, they weren't aware of it. But they did have a fee. Locally, the Chord Busters sometimes charged between $35 to $50 (with $100 being the most ever). For out of town gigs, which were rare 'cause there weren't too many places to go and no way to get there, they waived their fee and got train fare, hotel, and some meals. Lem Childers was still very active with the quartet. He was, in fact, the fifth member. The guys took him to many of their bookings and even shared their quartet pay with him. 

One performance stands out. They dropped by a Tulsa hospital to sing for a friend. They soon found themselves entertaining the entire floor of patients and staff. The head nurse asked if they would consider singing for a special patient. They, of course, agreed and he was wheeled into the room. He was in an &quot;extremely tense state&quot;. They proceeded to sing Kathleen and by the second verse they noticed he began to relax. So much so that when they had finished, he was slumped over in the chair, completely relaxed. The head nurse informed them that the patient had suffered an extreme nervous breakdown and had been in the hospital for over a week. They had been unable to break through the tension. He could now be treated successfully. This made a great impact on the quartet and helped put performing into a new perspective. 

The Chord Busters were asked to appear at the special dedication of the statue of Will Rogers at the Memorial near Claremore along with the Flat Foot Four and the Barflies, August 15, 1941. Less than a month later the Flat Foot Four's tenor, Johnny Whalen died, and the Chord Busters were honored to sing for their dear friend's Memorial Show in Oklahoma City. The show raised money to pay off the mortgage of the Whalen's home. 

They often found themselves booked on shows with the Flat Foot Four and the Barflies. Mterwards the Tulsa and Bartlesville champions would swap members for fun and call themselves the &quot;Bar Busters&quot; or the &quot;Chord Flies&quot;.

The Chord Busters believed the National Contest to be more than just &quot;another annual competition&quot;. Despite pressure to compete again, in 1942 they began the tradition of past champions NOT entering future contests. Today, becoming once a champion, always a champion&quot; is the ultimate goal. They felt the position of &quot;gold medalist&quot; held special responsibilities and by banding together, they could give something back to the Society. It was Doc who conceived and began the &quot;World Champion's Club&quot;, predecessor to the current Association of International Champions 

In 1944, when gold medals were first presented, the previous winners were not included. Doc Enmeier saw the need for correcting that oversight and saw to it that ALL those who had won before 1944 received the gold medal each had earned. 
In July of 1943 the draft board stepped in to ruin all the fun. Masengale was the first to go - he selected the Army Air Corp. Holbrook soon followed going to the Marines. Doc and Greer were left home and the Chord Busters were inactive for over two years. 

By early 1946 all had made it back home safe and sound until Holbrook moved to Arkansas. The distance wasn't impossible until Greer decided to seek his fame and fortune in Hollywood. 

Years before, due to war rationing, The Chord Busters were unable to secure a recording contract. It was well into a farewell party for Greer they realized the next day would probably be the very last chance they would have to record &quot;their&quot; record. 
They met the next morning at a radio station and cut their only recording. They sang very well but the material being used was a &quot;soft plastic&quot; (shellac was a war casualty) therefore they only got to record each song with one take and with no playback. They finished in time for Bob to make his one o'clock train for the west coast. The studio results were acceptable, however, and the entire project (three 78 rpms) was produced for about $1,500. They sold them for $6.75 (including postage). They joke that the three record set is worth almost that much today. 

Bobbie returned home within the year and the Chord Busters continued with replacements such as Bob McCullough Sr. and Delbert Jackson. The official end came in  1957 when Tom was transferred to Houston. Greer suffered a stoke in 1973 at 60. It paralyzed his left side and affected his speech. Although his speech recovered well, he never was the same. They also lost track of Holbrook. 

Out of the blue, Holbrook resurfaced in 1982 and suggested a reunion. The original four were invited to sing the weekend of the November 6th Tulsa annual show and reunited after 36 years. The local press covered the event. They first met at a &quot;headquarters hotel&quot; and began singing (rehearsing) for the agreed afterglow appearance. They also gathered for a special dinner with family and friends and some VIP's like George McCaslin, John Loots, Mrs. Corrinne Cash and daughter Betty Anne.
The day of the show, they met again and prepared for their much anticipated appearance. Tom laughingly remembers:  &quot;Once in a while we would hit a chord in balance with good blend, but thirty-six years took its toll on our memories, however, we enjoyed our singing together IMMENSELY.&quot; 

They sang their last song together on the afterglow and received a heartfelt standing ovation. Afterwards, they returned to hotel - sang some more - and sometime after 3am, retired to their separate rooms. Just six months later, on May 25, 1983, news came that Bob Holbrook had died of cancer at the age of 68 in Las Vegas. If he had known of his illness, he hadn't told anyone.
With Delbert Jackson gone (May 28, 1982) at the age of 66, and Bob Mccullough passing on February 17, 1983 at 69, death had claimed three of the six Chord Busters all within a years time. Bobbie Greer was lost October 28, 1985 at 72 and Doc Enmeier passed away on December 29, 1993 at the age of 9l. Tom died April 25, 1998 at 87.

The Chord Buster's last hurrah was during the 1991 International convention held in Louisville. Tom and Doc were invited to attend as special VIP guests (although at the last minute, Doc was unable for health reasons). On hand was a special exhibit prepared by Ruth Joyce, curator of Heritage Hall, showcasing the quartet's history. 

On Saturday night the 10,000 barbershoppers attending witnessed a fitting tribute emceed by fellow gold medalist, Dick Gifford including a video taped tribute, and Acoustix singing the original 1941 arrangement of &quot;When the Bees Are In The Hive/ Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland&quot;. It was in celebration of the 50th anniversary of their championship.

The Flat Foot Four was organized in the Oklahoma City Police Department by the Mayor, O. A. Cargill, in 1923. The quartet's personnel changed many times over the years, but Johnny Whalen was always the tenor. 

The original foursome was Whalen, lead Frank Sheppard, Roland Cargill, the mayor's brother, on baritone, and bass Bill Parrish. The quartet made their first public appearance at a meeting of the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce. 

Losing and replacing an average of one man per year, the quartet was still functioning in 1939 when Whalen, with Britt Stegal, lead, baritone Granville Scanland, and bass Sam Barnes competed against some 20 quartets at the first SPEBSQSA national contest in Tulsa and came in fourth. 

In the summer of 1940 at the New York World's Fair, with Red Elliott in the baritone spot, the Flat Foot Four copped the championship from a field of 200 entrants.

'''Flat Foot Four by Grady Kerr'''&lt;br /&gt;
''taken from Golden Memories - History of the Southwestern District - pub 1996''&lt;br /&gt;

The quartet has quite an interesting history. '''Johnny Whalen''' (tenor), '''Britt Stegall''' (lead), '''Red Elliott''' (baritone), and '''Sam Barnes''' (bass) were, as you might have guessed, all policemen and the pride of Oklahoma City. They were not, however, the original foursome. The first police quartet formed way back in 1924. 

The mayor of Oklahoma City, O.A. Cargill, thought four singing cops would be a &quot;novelty&quot;. The problem was, there weren't four cops in the whole town who could do anything with Sweet Adeline or I've Been Working On the Railroad. At least that's the was the way Daily Oklahoman newspaper described it, There were two good voices on the force. One was Frank Sheppard, a jailer, and desk sergeant Bill Parrish. It so happens that the mayor's brother (a car salesmen) Roland Cargill could sing and he knew another car salesmen who was a fine tenor. The four had sung together before. 

When the mayor heard the quartet, he gave the two salesmen some extra uniforms and appointed the four an official police quartet. A year later, Whalen, the tenor, had joined the force along with new baritone, Red Elliott. It was then they were first called, The Flat Foot Four and the name fit well. Even with a six year &quot;ban&quot; by a new police chief who thought singing was less than professional, they continued to sing together, but not as an &quot;official police quartet&quot; 

Over the course of their legacy, there were many participants in the quartet as members retired or accepted other law enforcement work. The other members include Ralph Kaylor, Bill West, Jack Roberts, Lefty Walker, Sleepy Chapman, and Frank Heffington. Several were also talented enough to switch parts over the years to keep the quartet going. But for all of their 17 years, Whalen remained as the only original member and their only tenor. 

'''A New Chief To The Rescue''' 

In 1937 Mr. Granville Scanland became chief of police. Since he was known for his fine baritone voice, one of his first acts was to restore the quartet (he sometimes pulled rank and sang along). With more personnel changes, Stegall and Barnes joined the quartet and, as legend has it, the blend was exceptional. By 1938, their popularity had grown and quartetting demanded much of their time. 

When the Society was organized in 1938, it didn't take a detective to figure out that OK City would be the site of a new chapter and the Flat Foots would become members. In the first national contest held in Tulsa in 1939 they competed with Scanland singing baritone. They only placed fourth. 

They won the qualifying state contest in the spring of 1940 by a wide margin and won the right to travel to New York City and the Worlds Fair for the Second Annual National Convention and Contest. The second contest took place on July 26, 1940 and was judged by such celebrities as former New York Governor Al Smith, Mayor La Guardia, Fred Waring, Sigmund Spaeth, Geoffrey O'Hara (composer of The Old Songs), Harry Armstrong (composer of Sweet Adeline) and [[O.C Cash]]. Instrumental accompaniment was permitted but scarcely used. There were 200 other quartets in that competition. 

'''Serving With Harmony''' 

Following their win and their becoming our &quot;World Champions&quot;, they made hundreds of appearances nationwide. They were named the official American Legion Quartet for the state of Oklahoma. Since the Flat Foot Four's inception, every man who had sung with the quartet had been a World War I veteran. 

Thanks to Columbia Records, they were one of the first quartets signed to produce a recording. The four record set of 78s includes all their standards: Annie Laurie, Old Aunt Dinah, Ride Tenderfoot Ride, Oh Joe, Maggie Blues, My Mother's Rosary, Harbor Lights Yodel, and Shine. 

As &quot;model policemen&quot;, they also served the community on the job. Whalen was well known for his work with area children. Giving lectures for schools and just talking to kids he served the people he protected. His outgoing personality gained him many friends and much respect among his peers. On September 6th, 1941, The Flat Foot Four sang at the Phillips Petroleum Company Community House southeast of OKC. On the way home, Johnny Whalen suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and was rushed to the hospital. He died a week later at the age of 44. 

The story was front page news and reading the coverage, one can see that all of Oklahoma City suffered in the loss. Both the [[Bartlesville Barflies]] (1939 champs) and the [[Chord Busters]] (1941 champs) sang during the service.


'''The City Responds'''

A huge Johnny Whalen Memorial show was soon announced. Sponsored by the local chapter, and lead by Big Bill Morris, talent from all over Oklahoma answered the call. It turned out there were two memorial shows held. The first was a special screening of the movie, &quot;Lady Be Good&quot; at the Criterion Theater on September 27 with over 300 people attending. 

The stage show was held on the 30th at the Municipal Auditorium. The show featured The Barflies, The Chord Busters, a 600 voice chorus including members from Tulsa, and 16 other entertainment acts including skaters, indian dancers, radio stars and other quartets from all over the Southwest. The finale was an appearance by the three remaining members of the Flat Foot Four. The show was a sell out. All services were donated and the money raised went to the Whalen family to pay the mortgage of their home, debts, and for his two children, Mike (5) and Patricia (3). 

What ever happened to The Flat Foot Four? Unfortunately, few know the answer. After Johnny died, they tried to find another tenor but never did. It just didn't seem right. The other three were &quot;officially&quot; invited to attend the Third Annual Parade of Champions in Chicago in 1946, but could not attend. Britt continued to sing with the chapter and sang with the Boresome Foursome for many years with Grady Musgrave, Ernie Dick, and Hank Wright. 

The remaining members of the quartet have all passed away. Bass, Sam Barnes died October 4, 1958 at 59. Lead, Britt Stegall died on October 11, 1961 at 69. And baritone, Clyde &quot;Red&quot; Elliot passed away July 22, 1969 at the age of 72.
 

'''But What Were They Really Like?'''
 
Seeking first hand knowledge, I asked Tom Masengale of the Chord Busters what he thought of the Flat Foot Four. 

''&quot;They had a big sound, I remember them coming on stage, removing the microphone, and filling the hall with sound. They were excellent showmen and sang songs the audience wanted to hear. One of the reasons for their popularity was they always &quot;milked the chords&quot;. They weren't the best quartet I've ever heard, but they were the most enjoyable and gave me the most pleasure out of listening as any quartet I've heard since. They really enjoyed singing and everyone in the audience could tell.&quot;'' 

Despite their short history as one of our past society gold medalists, the Flat Foot Four played an important part in our past. Their contribution to our heritage should not be overlooked.

'''Side Street Ramblers'''&lt;br /&gt;
''written and researched by Grady Kerr''&lt;br /&gt;
''taken from Golden Memories - The History of the Southwestern District - pub 1996''

One night in late 1975, a six foot five inch bass named Earl Hagn walked into a Dallas [[Vocal Majority]] rehearsal.  He was soon approached by many three-man quartets. Three members of the final version (and recently disbanded) Stage Door Four talked him into joining them.  Earl made the fourth with Keith Houts (tenor), Jim Law (lead) and Dennis Malone (bari) and they decided on the name “Side Street Ramblers”.  So new to Barbershopping, Hagn originally thought “International” was a truck.

They qualified for [[Southwestern District#Contests | District]], and in San Antonio the Ramblers won the audience and the contest with &quot;Gotta Be on My Way&quot;.  Being named district quartet champions only 90 days after forming made them an &quot;overnight success&quot;.  They are perhaps the only district champion to win the title of novice champs in the same contest.  

They qualified for the 1977 [[BHS International Convention | International]] in Philadelphia but placed a disappointing 28th place.

Lead Jim Law decided to retire from his law practice and moved to New Mexico. A talented artist, Jim went on to create the sculpture now seen on the current International Quartet Trophy.  In a move that would become a Ramblers tradition, in stepped their coach, Bill Thornton, lead of the 1973 [[Dealer's Choice]].

In Minneapolis at the 1979 International, they won chorus gold medals with the [[Vocal Majority]], and placed seventh in the quartet contest.

In 1980 at the Salt Lake City International the Ramblers decided to try something unique. They carried a theme throughout all three sets. They staged different phases of the Civil War. The Ramblers placed 7th once again. Thornton attacking the mic didn’t help.

Bill moved to Oklahoma and, in keeping with tradition (and proving they can make ANY lead sound good) - in stepped their coach Brian Beck, Bari of the 1973 [[Dealer's Choice]].  The Ramblers were gaining popularity around the country as an excellent show quartet.  They sang on countless shows in the States and abroad.

At the 1981 Detroit International, despite Earl having both arms in slings from a biking accident, they moved up to THIRD. 

They placed THIRD again at the 1982 International contest in Pittsburgh.

Seattle, 1983, would finally be their city and their year. 

A screenplay writer couldn't have placed the Ramblers in a more dramatic position. They were chosen to sing LAST in the Top Ten final session. They just happened to have a surprise ending planned.  They ended the entire contest with a special &quot;killer&quot; TAG.  This received the only standing ovation of the entire quartet contest.

They soon appeared on the Phil Donahue Show.

The next six years included recordings and world travels. They performed at [[BHS Mid-Winter Convention | Mid-Winter]] in Hawaii, traveled to Switzerland, Italy, Singapore, Austria, Australia and New Zealand, England's 1988 [[BABS]] convention and even a cruise from LA to Acapulco.

The Ramblers give credit to their coaches, legendary Don Clause and John and Tom Sommer of Columbus, Ohio.

The Ramblers recorded [[#Recordings | two fine albums]], the first in 1982 entitled creatively enough, “Side Street Ramblers” and then “Seems Like Yesterday” in 1985. Both were re-released on ENCORE!

In 1988, Brian left to rejoin the reunited [[Dealer's Choice]], so in stepped their coach and super lead #4 - Jim Casey for their last year.  They retired following the 1989 [[AIC]] show.  Sadly, we lost Jim Casey on May 5, 2007 and Earl Hagn January 16, 2006.  Their last appearance together on stage was during Earl Hagn’s induction into the SWD Hall of Fame October 22nd, 2005.

Few champs have been better goodwill ambassadors for barbershopping and the Society. The Ramblers made many friends and fans worldwide. All still remember them as gold medal performers and gold medal guys.

'''A “Classic” Success Story'''&lt;br /&gt;
By Sally and Mike Davidson&lt;br /&gt;

The story of the 1982 Int’l Quartet Champion Classic Collection is pretty unique in many respects.

It all began in Hastings Nebraska in 1968.  Original baritone, and long-time barbershop enthusiast, &quot;Papa Joe&quot; Heltne, and his son Terry invited two aspiring singers, one a natural tenor and the other an operatic vocal major from the Hastings College choir, to join them for an evening of singing.  Before it was over, Larry Wilson a lead, and Curt Hutchison, a tenor, agreed that this foursome, originally called “Three Lads and a Dad,” should stay together.  They worked hard and rose in the ranks of the Central States District.  After a short hiatus due to Larry’s four year stint in the Navy, they changed their name to “Classic Collection”, and eventually found themselves the winners of the 1975 [[Central States District]] Quartet Championship. 
 
'''A Unique “Transplant” to Colorado'''
Greater economic opportunities in nearby Denver, Colorado would beckon the three younger men in October of 1975.  All three eventually moved from Hastings to Denver and soon found themselves members of the Denver Mile-Hi barbershop chapter. From previous [[Central States District]] quartet contests, they were already acquainted with young tenor, George Davidson.  Over the next months, they became good friends as George made the necessary adjustments to learn to sing a “mean” baritone, filling in for the “woodshedding” trio, itching to “bust one” after chapter meetings.  Eventually the distance and an unfortunate bout with cancer made it necessary for Joe (who was still living in Hastings) to retire. With his unqualified blessing, George replaced the ailing Papa Joe in October, 1976.  Thus began another unique chapter in the history of their barbershop lives.  

'''A Unique “Double” Quartet Championship'''
In 1977 Classic Collection won another district contest and became the first quartet champion of the newly created [[Rocky Mountain District]].  By achieving the fledgling district’s highest honor at its very first convention, they became the ONLY Society quartet ever to have captured the championship in TWO different districts.   

'''Unique Dedication and Perseverance Pays Off'''
Harkening back to their early quartet days, this hardworking, conscientious quartet strived each year to hone their skills, and dramatically improve their scores. After 6 years on the International contest stage, (rising through the ranks that started at 32nd place in 1976) they had stuck with it long enough and worked hard enough to realize their dream.  In 1982 they achieved the coveted gold medal and lifetime honor of International Quartet Champion.

'''A Unique Record Breaking Win'''
They won the contest in GRAND style.  They earned the largest winning margin (296 points) in the 43 year history of the competition --- a proud mark that stood another 11 years (until 1993 when the Gas House Gang’s margin of victory was 5 points greater -- 301 pts.).

'''A Unique Standard of Longevity'''
Not willing to rest on their laurels, the quartet's unique style and sound , extraordinary musicianship, outstanding arrangements, showmanship and solid reputation for being not only committed Barbershoppers, but four great guys carried them through one of the longest active and uninterrupted singing careers of any international champion.  With a very active schedule, they went on to thrill audiences around the US, Canada and Europe from 1982 to 2002, without stopping.
 
2007 not only marks their 25th anniversary of winning the gold medal but marks their 31st anniversary as a quartet – with the same personnel.  

'''A Unique Friendship'''
While many of today’s quartets must travel across the country and even across national borders to get together - during the heyday of the Classic Collection they all lived within a 10 minute drive of each other in the Denver area. The Classic Collection has truly become a band of brothers in their time together.  

Not only have they made great music and captivated many audiences worldwide, they very naturally have become best friends. Although recently, opportunities have spread them geographically apart and into other parts of Colorado and neighboring states, these four guys still get together whenever there is an opportunity, much to the delight of their audiences, friends and family. Not surprisingly, the “magic” is still there.

'''The Quartet Today -- Where Are They Now?''' 
Two of the quartet members have recently taken early retirement.  George, the baritone, has retired after 33 years with the premier Denver area school district.  Curt, tenor, retired from a long and distinguished career as an insurance underwriter.  Larry continues his work as a sought after insurance industry mogul in Scottsdale, AZ, and Terry continues to thrive in his successful real estate career, in beautiful Eagle County, Colorado.

Their friendship and legacy lives on in current Society and [[Sweet Adelines International | Sweet Adeline]] contests with many of their arrangements sung still to this day on the International stage.  Their sweet harmony, commitment to the craft and incredible personality not only as a quartet, but as individuals, may never be matched.

'''Chicago News'''

To relatively new barbershoppers, the Chicago News, when they won the international championship in 1981, seemed to have come almost &quot;out of the blue.&quot; 

True, they had placed second in 1980 and 8th in their first competition the year before, but compared to foursomes that struggled a dozen years to reach the gold, the &quot;News&quot; was a rash newcomer. 

In fact, however, the '81 victory gave tenor Ray Henders, lead Butch Koth, bari Greg Wright and bass Tom Felgen a total of 19 international medals - 7 bronze, 7 silver, and 5 gold - won in four different quartets. For Tom, bass of the 1965 champion [[Four Renegades]], it was a second gold. 

Tom and Greg had been singing in quartets since they were about 10 years old, while Butch was a singer in high school. Ray, however, had been quartetting for &quot;only&quot; about 25 years. 

Among the four of them they had performed with dozens of quartets. Ray's included the [[Midnight Oilers]], one of the first to perform overseas for U.S. servicemen, and the [[Soundtracks]], bronze medalists in 1974. Greg and his brother Larry (then lead of the [[139th Street Quartet]]) had sung with the [[Sundowners]], twice silver medalists and later with a professional pop-singing group. Butch was lead of the [[Landmarks]], district champs and international competitors. 

With these backgrounds, the Chicago News became an &quot;overnight sensation&quot; in 1981.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17797">[[Image:1939Pic.jpg|right|border|Bartlesville Barflies]]The '''Bartlesville Barflies''' is the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]]'s 1939 [[International Quartet Champion]].

In 1937 the American Legion in Bartlesville, Oklahoma decided to put on a minstrel show. New in town, a wiry little man by the name of Harry Hall who was born and raised in England, had produced a minstrel show in Pawhuska, OK so he got the job of putting this show together. 

All the men in town were invited to participate and sing. Having some experience with singing close harmony, George McCaslin was appointed as committee of one to come up with a quartet. Just like that - abracadabra. 

McCaslin listened around and discovered that one of the minstrel end men, Herman Kaiser, was doing a good job of putting the bass to the choral songs. Harry Hall volunteered to sing tenor but as chairman of the quartet committee, McCaslin made Hall sing the lead part and took the tenor for himself. Someone suggested that there was a young, just-out-of-college baritone down at the First National Bank. 

With the usual skepticism of a quartet man searching for a good baritone, McCaslin dropped in to have a look at Bob Durand and invited him to a quartet rehearsal. Their first session sounded good; the resulting Bartlesville American Legion Minstrel Quartet was the hit of the show. 

The following year, [[O. C. Cash]] was looking for a quartet to sing at the state teacher's convention in Tulsa and asked McCaslin if his quartet was available. They were willing to sing and O. C. informed the local newspaper. Cash told a reporter covering the story that the quartet was called the Bartlesville Barflies. 

Owen Cash not only founded the [[Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America]], but he named what would turn out to be its first championship quartet.

'''Bartlesville Barflies'''&lt;br /&gt;
''written and researched by Grady Kerr''&lt;br /&gt;
''taken from Golden Memories - The History of the [[Southwestern District]] - pub 1996''

Our very first quartet champions didn't set out to be world famous, they just loved to sing. As it turned out, they became our first gold medalists, almost became our second gold medalists and were the first society quartet to appear in the movies.

It was the goal of the American Legion of Bartlesville, Oklahoma (47 miles north of Tulsa) to put on a minstrel show in 1937 that forced the need of good quartet. New Legionnaire Harry Hall was asked to put the show together since he had experience. All the men in Bartlesville were invited to participate and sing. Legionnaire George McCaslin had experience with quartetting so Hall asked him to form the much needed quartet. 

Hall volunteered to sing the tenor (claiming to have sung with the best quartet in America&quot; for William Jennings &quot;Billie&quot; Bryan's presidential campaign in 1908). But as chairman of the quartet committee, McCaslin convinced Hall to sing lead and saved the tenor part for himself. 

Finding the right baritone and bass was beginning to become difficult until McCaslin discovered that one of the minstrel men, Herman Kaiser, was doing a great job of putting the bass to the choral songs. He was asked to sing in the quartet. 

News of prospective bari named Bob Durand, a young college grad working at Bartlesville First National Bank, reached the committee. With considerable skepticism, McCaslin dropped in to have a look at him and invited him to a quartet rehearsal. In their first session together Bob's baritone passed the test with flying colors. 

Two weeks later, after rehearsing without sheet music and arranging by ear, they brought the house down singing When Uncle Joe Plays a Rag on his Old Banjo, Ragtime Cowboy Joe, and Love Me and the World is Mine. As you might have guessed, the resulting &quot;Bartlesville American Legion Minstrel Quartet&quot; was the hit of the show. 
  
'''WHAT'S IN A NAME?''' 
The following year, [[O.C. Cash]] was looking for a quartet to sing at a prestigious state teachers' convention in Tulsa and asked McCaslin if his quartet was available. The quartet agreed but unbeknownst to them, when Cash was asked by the press the name of the foursome, Cash didn't know. O.C. remembered a quartet back home in Blue Jacket called the &quot;Barflies&quot; and informed the news media they would hear the Bartlesville Barflies&quot; After that, the name stuck. 

Several years later, McCaslin wrote: It did seem that there was an abundance of creative talent in those early years and that quartets (the Orpheum and Keith Vaudeville circuits almost always had a quartet booked as part of the regular show) attracted men who could improvise - men who knew chords and how to put them together: The Barflies happened to be blessed with four guys who had, independently, been attracted to the foot lights long before we met.
  
'''GEORGE McCASLIN''' 
1901 -January 2, 1985 
The son of a minister and Missouri bred, George made his living as an insurance salesman but was best known to all as a quartet man. A charter member of the Society, he also directed the local [[SAI | Sweet Adeline]] chorus. As a member of many civic organizations he was a real people person&quot; and loved to sing. He died in 1985 at the age of 83 followed by his beloved wife, Lillian, three years later. Their son, Jim, passed away in 1994 and their son Tom is an accomplished musician who currently lives and performs in Tulsa. 
  
'''HARRY HALL''' 
September 19, 1890 - July 9, 1960 
Harry Hall was born and raised in Hetton-Le-Hole, Durham County, England (and he wouldn't let you forget it) and came to the U.S. in 1914. Settling in West Frankfort, Illinois, he soon married Maude May Fuell on September 14, 1914. After joining the U.S. Army, Harry served overseas in Europe and was discharged in 1919 and soon after moved to Pawhuska, Oklahoma. In 1937 Harry moved to Bartlesville where he worked as a painting contractor. 
He quickly became active in several civic organizations joining the local Akdar Temple, Kara Grotto, Elks Lodge, A F &amp; A M, Knights of Pythias Lodge, Painters Local 695, Shriners, Masonic Lodge, Scottish Rite Club, and American Legion. Perhaps looking for another organization to join, Harry was in attendance at the first Tulsa meeting April 11, 1938.
Maude, his wife of 36 years passed away in 1950. Harry soon after married Marjorie. He had two daughters. 

It was mid-week during the 1960 International convention, held in Dallas, when Harry became seriously ill. He was rushed back to Bartlesville where he passed away the Saturday morning of the convention at the age of 69. 
  
'''BOB DURAND''' 
1906 May 13, 1978 
A handsome young man, Bob was born in Junction City, Kansas where he graduated from high school in 1923. He attended the University of Kansas, sang in the U. of K. Glee Club and received his degree in 1927. His father was president of the bank and Bob proudly followed in his dad's footsteps. Following graduation he took a job offer at the First National Bank of Bartlesville. 

When Bob was called to service he joined the Air Force and earned the rank of Captain before his honorable discharge in 1946. He returned home and married Mary Mustard and raised three daughters. Bob worked his way up to Senior Vice President at the bank and retired in 1968 after 41 years of service. 
He was also active in several civic organizations: The Masonic Lodge, Kiwanis Club, Scottish Rite Bodies, and Akdar Shrine. He unselfishly gave of his time and talent and served as treasurer of the Bartlesville Chamber of Commerce as well as the Bartlesville Welfare Association. 
After passing the &quot;audition&quot; and joining the Barflies, Bob's dad (also a quartet man) taught the quartet by rote a beautiful 1882 ballad entitled White Wings. It became a popular addition to their repertoire. 

After a long illness, Bob passed away on May 13,1978 at the age of 72. 
  
'''HERMAN E KAISER''' 
1900 - February 23 1965 
Born in Sweet Springs, Missouri, Herman sang bass for 22 years in the Bartlesville Presbyterian choir. He too belonged to several local civic organizations such as the Kiawanians, and several Masonic bodies. Herman worked for Phillips Petroleum from 1922 to 1964 (who later hired them to promote the company) and retired as a senior purchasing agent. He died February 23, 1965 at the age of 65 and was survived by his wife, Mildred. 

'''FAMOUS OR INFAMOUS''' 
As early as Monday, the week of the society's first national convention, the local papers started building up the event. There were already several quartets in town staying at the Mayo and Tulsa Hotels. Tulsa really got on the bandwagon and just about every organization in town who had a luncheon wanted a quartet. Most of them got one. 
The papers went ahead and &quot;picked&quot; the winner and runners up several days before the contest. The [[Capital City Four]] from Springfield, Illinois was picked to win and the [[Flat Foot Four]] of Oklahoma City was to be second. 

The Barflies didn't even decide to compete until the last minute. On Friday afternoon they headed for Tulsa and sang in the semi-finals. 
George said &quot;I can't recall that we broke into the charmed circle that night. . . we were hoping for third.&quot; 
One of their contest songs was the well known Mandy Lee. Mandy Lee was such a hit, 14 competing quartets sang it the next year in the New York contests. 
The next night after singing in the finals, George recalled: &quot;...it was so close, they had us and the Capital City Four come back out and sing another song&quot;. By the slimmest of margins, the Barflies were named &quot;World Champion Barbershop Quartet&quot;. 
For their win they received the new title and a check for $50.00. It worked out to $12.50 apiece and they're not even sure if they ever cashed the check. 
George  McCaslin said of the event:
There were ten judges when we stepped on stage at Central High to make history. But for the grace of God and a few simple barbershop chords the Barflies would have been forgotten before the ink was dry on the Sunday editions. 
It was amazing. Newspapers all over the United States picked up the story and the Barflies became famous. Things sorta got outa hand a bit from then on for the next year. 
They did appear on [[#Recordings | a recording]] with several other quartets from the contest. It was made by Decca and included two favorite Barflies' medleys: Love Me and The World Is Mine - Just A Dream Of You Dear- When The Harbor Lights Are Burning and Wait Till The Sun Shines Nellie - By The Watermelon Vine, Lindy Lou - By The Light Of The Silvery Moon. 

Someone came along after the contest and offered the Barflies a contract to do three weeks in Vegas but they didn't have the time. Phillips Petroleum (Herman's employer) offered to sponsor them if they would change their name to the &quot;Phillips 66 Barflies&quot;. They agreed and as it turned out, it was a pretty good combination for the quartet as well as the society. They were flown all over the south during various company advertising campaigns and enjoyed what they called the &quot;meatballs and pea circuit&quot;. 
George and Harry competed in the first seven national quartet contests helping set the pace for the new society. Son Tom McCaslin still has George's medal collection including the rarest of all. 

'''KEYS TO SUCCESS''' 
Probably no top ranking quartet got by on less rehearsing than the Barflies. They picked their songs, learned them separately and got together only to work out the timing and polish 'em up. They were blessed with two high tenors, a high bari, and a low bari, The Barflies had little trouble with pitch unless Harry was having a bad day. Harry, said to have perfect pitch, refused to allow the Barflies to use a pipe. He said he could always get the right pitch. It may have been right for Harry, but sometimes, when he was feeling good or the audience got him a little excited, he'd pitch it high. Heaven help 'em if he pitched it low! 
McCaslin remembered a funeral they sang for in Bartlesville once where he disdained to use the pitch pipe which George had in his pocket. &quot;It was the most pitiful sound I've ever been a part of and I'm sure we contributed our share of depression to the grieved. We muddled through Rock of Ages using Harry's &quot;perfect pitch&quot;. It was the last funeral we ever sang and I never trusted Harry for the pitch again&quot;. 
&quot;Harry was way too temperamental for his own good, in spite of the fact that he was a good showman. Now and then he'd want me to change the pitch depending on how he felt. I never gave in to him again and after a decade or more, he finally conceded that he probably didn't have perfect pitch&quot;. 
With no rules about past champs competing, the Barflies returned to competition in 1940 in New York City where the second national contest was being held at the World's Fair. Over 50 quartets entered the fray but, for the second year in a row, the Barflies were in the finals. Although no score sheets exist, it's said the margin of victory was one point&quot;. The [[Flat Foot Four]] were named champions and the Barflies came in second. 
One of their highlights was singing for the unveiling of the statue of Will Rogers at his Memorial in Claremore, Oklahoma on August 15th, 1941. The events were broadcast live, coast to coast by radio. Also performing were the [[Chord Busters]] and the [[Flat Foot Four]]. 
In 1941 they again competed for the title, this time in the St. Louis contests and out of the 54 quartets there, they came in a strong third behind the Chord Busters and Kansas City Barberpole Cats. They also placed third the following year in Grand Rapids, Michigan once again behind the Polecats. 

Bob Durand was drafted into the Army immediately following the contest in 1942 and the Barflies split up. George and Harry (tenor and bass) decided to form another quartet out of Tulsa called the Mainstreeters. Bill Palmer (bari) and Fred Graves (bass), formerly with the Mystic Four, completed the foursome and they became just about as popular as the Barflies had been and continued to perform on a regular basis.
 
In the spring of 1946, Durand returned from the Army and the Barflies were reunited to sing their [[swan song]] on the annual Oklahoma City chapter's Parade of Quartets. Like many quartets, one swan song is not enough. They went on to make two more &quot;final appearances&quot; in Bartlesville that year. 

They reunited again in 1955 for a Tulsa and Bartlesville joint meeting and again in April of 1958 to help celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Tulsa chapter. Possibly their very last appearance as the Barflies was in 1959 in Kansas City for an Olde Timers Quartet Jamboree with over 600 enthusiasts in attendance. The Barflies performances were quite unique.
Since Harry couldn't make the trip, they held auditions during the day for leads to fill-in for Hall. The lucky ones were Dana Durand (brother), Jim Poindexter, Don McPherson, and J. E. Dooley. Each man &quot;rehearsed with an audience&quot; one number with the Society's first champions. It may have been the original &quot;[[sing with the champs]]&quot;. The Barflies claimed it was their 167th &quot;final appearance&quot;. 
By this time, Harry and George's other quartet was gaining national popularity. They were called the Flying L Ranch Quartet. One of their biggest fans was Roy Turner, owner of the Flying L Ranch (near Davis) and soon-to-be Oklahoma's Governor. Also an amateur song writer, Turner penned Hereford Heaven. 

'''HAPPY TRAILS TO HOLLYWOOD''' 
The song became popular and Roy asked his favorite quartet to perform it. In the summer of 1946, Roy Rogers decided to use the song and the quartet in his movie, &quot;Home in Oklahoma&quot;. Each quartet member was renamed: Harry &quot;Shorty&quot; Hall, Bill &quot;Smiley&quot; Palmer, Fred &quot;Stumpy&quot; Graves, George &quot;Slats&quot; MeCaslin for the movie. Some of the filming took place on the Flying L Ranch and some took place in Hollywood. Gabby Hayes also appeared in the film. 
The Flying L Ranch Quartet was invited to sing at Roy Rogers and Dale Evans' wedding December 31, 1947 at The Flying L Ranch. Recently Roy and Dale were contacted and recalled: We remember what great voices they had&quot;. 
High profile events continued to seek out this popular quartet. In addition to singing for Roy Turner's inauguration on January 13, 1947, they performed for the Truman Presidential Inauguration in 1949. 
The Flying L continued in various forms for many years with replacements such as Bob McCullough (lead), Gene Earl (bari), Bob Kirk (bari) and Gene Nash (lead). They are reported to have been active as late as 1951.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2113">[[Image:1947Pic.jpg|right|border|Doctors of Harmony]]The '''Doctors of Harmony''' is the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]]'s 1947 [[International Quartet Champion]].

When the Elkhart, Indiana chapter of SPEBSQSA was formed in September 1943, Ron Younce, lead; Lee &quot;Reverend&quot; Kidder, bass; and Elton &quot;Butch&quot; Hummel, bari were already looking for a tenor they could push around. They found H.H. &quot;Jumbo&quot; Smith, standing five feet tall in his socks and weighing 125 pounds. 

Kidder and Hummel had sung together in a high school quartet; Smith had sung as a baritone with two professional quartets and had been an acrobatic performer on the vaudeville stage. Younce went into the Navy and was replaced by Max &quot;Junior&quot; Cripe in the spring of 1944. 

The Doctors of Harmony became the first Indiana state quartet champion at a contest held in January, 1945. Thirteen quartets competed. The quartet entered international competition in 1945 and placed fifth. The following year, they finished third place and in 1947 they won the international championship. 

According to the Doctors, a prescription of hard work earned them the gold medals. One of the songs they sang in competition was a new tune entitled Mississippi Moon, written by Jumbo Smith, ending a rumor that judges only liked familiar songs. 

The quartet disbanded in 1950. Kidder sang bass in the 1953 [[Cardinal District]] champion Clef Chefs, a quartet that became an international semifinalist in 1953 and 1954.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6485">[[image:2005 J.A.D. Champs - Hot Air Buffoons.jpg|right|375px]]The '''Hot Air Buffoons''' first weighed in back in 1996. We set out on a quest to sing well and entertain our audiences in a fashion they have never seen before. We soon surprised ourselves and others by not only making people laugh but by progressing in the competition realm as well. We excelled in a competition that was MADE for us and took home gold medals and a pretty large trophy (which signifies 1st place) in the 2001 internationally renowned [[Buckeye Invitational]] Comedy Quartet Competition in Columbus, Ohio. Try saying that 5 times real fast. We have continued in the competition realm and are now the 2005 [[Johnny Appleseed District]] Champions. We have also competed internationally and have been ranked in the top 50 quartets for the last 5 years and as high as 16th, twice. Despite our successes in the competition venue, our true love is to entertain. The BUFFOONS have performed on a number of chapter shows (pick any number between 1 and 1,000,000) and if you ask anyone that we have performed for, they will confirm that we are never serious (nor do we want to be). If you have seen us before, we hope that you have enjoyed our performance and have fully recovered from the injuries suffered from &quot;sidesplitting&quot; laughter. But, if you haven't had the chance to hear the unique style of the HOT AIR BUFFOONS, we encourage you to lock yourself in your storm cellar now, because before long, we'll be everywhere and you'll find yourself sucked into our stupid humor and crazy antics. We just ask one thing, DON'T MAKE FUN OF THE FAT GUY!!!!!!!!!!

This recording is available through the Harmony Marketplace and a-cappella.com

== Bios ==
'''Randy &quot;Beef&quot; Baughman''' sings the bass part and was born in Dover, Ohio at the delicate size of 4lbs, 8ozs. He has since put on weight and moved to Bowling Green, Ohio where he resides with his wife, Janine, and son, William. In real life, Randy teaches music at Whitmer High School in Toledo. His first a capella singing group was Melvin and the Nuclear Turnips while in high school. In college, Richard Mathey and the University Men's Chorus introduced Randy to barbershop music. He also performed two summers in a barbershop quartet at Cedar Point Amusement Park. Competition soon beckoned, and Randy's first quartet, the [[Varsity Lettermen]], placed in the top ten their first time out! They would place no higher. His second quartet, the Varsity Lettermen (it was easier to get three new guys than a new name), placed third in their first competition! They would place no higher. Realizing that competition just wasn't working out, Randy joined a group called [[Yesteryear]] in 1985 just to have fun. They won the District competition in 1993 and went on to win the International competition in 1997. They would place no higher. Since Yesteryear retired in 2000, Randy joined up with the Hot Air Buffoons, just to have fun.


'''Harry Haflett''' sings the baritone part. Harry resides in Euclid Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. Harry works nights and has a degree in Music Education. Harry is a second-generation barbershopper and has been a member of the Society since 1983. Harry Haflett harbors hopes of hopping happily on horses hooves, however, hardly has it happened.


'''Mark Lang''' sings the lead part and is the least experienced barbershopper of the group. He is also the youngest, the shortest, the most handsome, the one with the lowest golf handicap, the one with the least amount of mental illness, and the one with the youngest kids. He has a beautiful wife, Pam, of just over 15 years (that's 15 years of marriage not 15 years of age) and 2 children, Alyssa (12) and Jonathan (10), both of which love to sing (barbershop none-the-less). Mark lives in Cortland, Ohio where he works as a nurse anesthetist. He says this is where he gets his &quot;sick&quot; sense of humor. His hobbies include anything his wife tells him to do. Aside from his hobbies, he is an avid Pittsburgh Steelers fan, but don't hold that against him because he can still admit it in public (humiliation enough). 


'''Denny Price''' sings the tenor part. Denny is a registered massotherapist (I guess you could say he gets paid to rub people the right way). He lives with his wife, Margie, who also sings in a Sweet Adeline's quartet and The [[Sounds of Pittsburgh]] Chorus, which Denny directs. He has attained the distinction of [[Master Director]] with this chorus as well. In his spare time he also directs the [[Penn-Ohio Singers]], a mens barbershop group in Sharon, PA near where he lives. He has 3 children, 6 grandchildren, and various animals of all shapes and sizes. Denny is considered the outsider of the quartet because he resides in West Middlesex, PA. He is the only grandfather in the quartet.

Out To Lunch (CD)

== Extended History ==
This quartet started out as 4 friends in the local [[Music City Chorus | Nashville, TN chapter]].  After singing around for fun, the quartet decided to make a go of it together as a comedy quartet, forming in the summer of 2007 right after the Denver International Convention.  Lunch Break [[Dixie District#District Champions | won the District]] that fall and went on to qualify in the Spring for Nashville's 2008 convention.  

Competing with songs and acts such as parodies of Elvis's &quot;Good Luck Charm&quot; as &quot;Lucky Charms&quot;, Lunch Break likes to self-deprecate while making so much fun of themselves, it's hard not to like them.  Usually, the stage has cereal all over it when they're done.

Lunch Break is also known for their infamous 2010 mic testing set for the finals, in which they brought up the other semi-finalists who did not make the top ten.  This led to a sound error that caused them to have to re-mic-test after the first contestant had already sung.

== Extended History ==

Our new champs are men who have won the gold medals once before. They won in convincing fashion in Anaheim, California July 4th week during the 71st International Convention and Contests of the Barbershop Harmony Society. Their total score average was 93.7% and they finished 213 points above the second place quartet.
 
Fred Farrell (tenor) sang with [[Second Edition]] during their gold medal win in 1989. This win makes Fred one of the 18 multiple champs with the longest span between wins (20 years). Mike Slamka (lead) won his first gold with [[Power Play]] in 2003. Baritone Brandon Guyton won his first with [[Four Voices]] in 2002. Dr. Jim Henry (bass) won his first championship with [[Gas House Gang]] in 1993. He also holds a historic distinction by also directing his chorus, The [[Ambassadors of Harmony]], to a Chorus Championship in the same year as they also won in Anaheim.
 
Crossroads considers their family to be an important part of the quartet. They boast 15 kids and one grandkid between them. Following the win they ALL spent the next day at Disneyland (all 24 of 'em).
 
They plan to spend the next year performing and continuing their quest for vocal musical perfection.

== Individual Histories ==
'''Jim Henry''' holds degrees in vocal music education, music theory and music composition, including a Ph.D. in music composition from Washington University. He is currently the Director of Choral Studies at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, where he conducts the University Singers and Vocal Point and teaches choral methods, choral arranging, and choral conducting. In addition to his duties at UM-St. Louis, Jim is the musical and artistic director of the [[Ambassadors of Harmony]], a 160-voice men's a cappella chorus that performs barbershop, jazz, and light classical music. The Ambassadors of Harmony have produced three recordings, and were recently named the best male barbershop chorus in the world at the Barbershop Harmony Society’s 2004 International Competition.

Jim was also a founding member, arranger, and bass singer with the legendary [[Gas House Gang]], the very popular 1993 International Quartet Champions. The Gas House Gang has entertained audiences in all fifty states and fifteen countries, and in venues from the Grand Ole Opry to Carnegie Hall. They have been featured on NBC’s “Today Show,” NPR's “At the Creation,” and two PBS specials: “Voices in Harmony” and “The Egg.” The Gas House Gang has produced [[Gas House Gang#Recordings | five recordings]]. Jim and his wife Geda live in St. Charles, Missouri, with their 2 young children; Gea Rose and Isaiah. Lydia their oldest daughter is recently married.

'''Brandon Guyton''' sings baritone, and is perhaps best known as a gold medallist with [[Four Voices]], the 2002 Champions of the Barbershop Harmony Society. Four Voices was a highly innovative and exciting college quartet that first got their start as part of the acclaimed Voices of Lee, A premier mixed vocal troupe from Lee University. Four Voices produced [[Four Voices#Recordings | two recordings]], performed in 44 states and 4 countries and performed in venues such as Lincoln Center and have shared the stage with a long list of artists including Bill Gaither and the Swingle Singers. Brandon and his wife Noemi live in Cleveland, Tennessee and have 3 children: Chandler, Taylor, and Isabella.

'''Mike Slamka''' sings the lead part, and he made his mark as the lead of [[Power Play]], an extremely popular all-family quartet that became International Barbershop Harmony Society Champions in 2003. In addition to Mike on lead, Power Play featured father Jack on bass, brother Mark on baritone, and cousin Don on Tenor. Their genuine love for one another and their family appeal, along with the uncanny ring in their sound made Power Play an audience favorite. Power Play produced [[Power Play#Recordings | three recordings]], has performed all over the country and has been featured on the Jane Pauley show as well as guest performers on The Grand Ole Opry. Mike and his wife Traci live in St.Clair, Michigan with their 3 daughters: Michaela, Mackenzi, and Madison.

'''Fred Farrell''' sings tenor, and was a member of the 1989 International Quartet Champion [[Second Edition]]. Known for their great sound and musical artistry, Second Edition is considered to be one of the most influential Barbershop quartets of the past 25 years. Second Edition produced [[Second Edition#Recordings | two recordings]], performed in 38 states and 6 countries sharing the stage with artists such as Michael Feinstein, Dizzy Gillespie, Rosemary Clooney, Marylin McCoo and Billy Davis Jr., with feature spots on ABC’s Nightly News, and Wolf Trap Theatre’s 50th anniversary gala concert which was broadcast on PBS. Fred and Kim live in Ft. Myers, Florida with their 5 kids: Olivia, Caroline, Quinn, Molly, and Lilly.

A young Florida quartet crowned as International champion in Philadelphia in 1961 was destined to become one of the most popular, active and long-lived in the Society's history: the Suntones. Formed less than three years earlier, the quartet sang for over 25 years, averaging 40 annual shows - more than 1,000 performances. It produced ten record albums and pioneered such show-business touches as individual microphones and a tall stool for each singer. 

Original members of the quartet were Gene Cokeroft, tenor; Bob Franklin, lead; Bill Wyatt, bari; and Bill Cain, bass. Harlan Wilson replaced Wyatt before they won the championship, and that foursome stayed together until Drayton Justus, former lead of the Gentlemen's Agreement, took over the lead slot when Bob retired in 1980. 

Next to the Buffalo Bills of The Music Man fame, the Suntones probably were the Society's best-known quartet, thanks mainly to their long run on Jackie Gleason's television show of the '60s. The quartet made numerous appearances and worked behind the scenes, providing background music and other services, for as long as the show originated from Miami.

== Extended History ==
'''The Suntones'''
'''researched and written by Grady Kerr'''

The Suntones performed from 1957 to 1985 and along the way recorded 10 albums and shared the bill with such greats as Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Mike Douglas and The Four Freshmen.

The Suntones began as a Miami &quot;chapter quartet&quot; in 1957 with Gene Cokeroft on tenor, Clark Bell singing lead, Bill Wyatt on baritone and Danny Whipple. Like many quartets they cut their teeth on good old barbershop songs and did them very well.

But soon families and draft boards took their toll on the original members of the Suntones and forced several personnel changes. In November of 1958 they were looking for a new bass.  

Into a chapter meeting walks Bill Cain. He sang a song with Gene and Bill and the new lead Bob Franklin. And they were impressed. They rehearsed nine nights in a row and entered the district contest.  

The Suntones placed second and were the surprise of the weekend. The very next year, 1959, the quartet qualified to compete at their first International Contest.  Despite Bob having the flu they placed 24th in Chicago in '59. 

That fall they won the first district championship of the newly formed [[Sunshine District]]. It was during that weekend they first met future Suntones baritone Harlan Wilson. 

One reason for their popularity was their innate ability to precisely tune very tight chords. This had inspired Bill Wyatt to write some wild and crazy arrangements.

In the spring of 1960, Wyatt had to withdraw from the quartet so they called Harlan in West Palm Beach. 

The quartet burned up the Florida Turnpike every other night for six weeks to win the right to represent the Sunshine District in Dallas that summer. They traveled to Dallas for the 1960 Int'l and did very well placing 8th.

They were also attracting the attention of the barbershop world, earning new fans and becoming one of the favorites to win &quot;someday&quot;.

In addition to singing the traditional barbershop style, the quartet really enjoyed singing more modern arrangements like those of the Four Freshmen.


They traveled to the 1961 International held in Philadelphia. After the quarter-finals the Suntones had the audience on their side by singing A Little Street Where Old Friends Meet and You're Nobody's Sweetheart Now. In the Semi-finals they performed Oh, How I Miss You Tonight and Mother Machree

Call it luck, destiny or a little bit of both, the Suntones were picked to sing LAST in the top ten final round of competition Saturday night. 

The audience reaction was unexpected by the quartet. It was clear The Suntones were a cut above and the audience and judges knew it.  Everyone would later discover that they would rack up a 343 point winning margin. 

They ended the contest that year with a song that would become one of their trademarks - Bye, Bye Blues.

Saturday night they got to sing one more song and accept the trophies.  They decided to sing the modern, I Had the Craziest Dream Last Night.

In hind sight, Gene says they probably could have selected a better song. So after being up all night singing they headed home in a sweltering hot, chartered, four prop Lockheed Constellation … still on cloud nine.

As with all International Quartet Champions, they were crowned, celebrated, cheered and treated like celebrities and sent home. 

Here is where some gold medal quartets begin to slowly but surely disappear. For the Suntones, this was only the beginning. 

They decided they might as well do this thing up right. This resulted in setting new standards and becoming innovators. The quartet produced recordings as often as possible.  This created a very impressive library. They carried their own sound system to bookings and performed with individual hand held microphones. They also expanded the exposure of barbershop quartets with a proactive management mindset and sought professional bookings outside of barbershop circles. 

Their heavy scheduled also forced them to improve and perfect their presentation. It was hard work that paid off. One example? The Suntones were soon found singing at New York's Plaza Hotel on the same bill as Benny Goodman. 

In 1966 when Jackie Gleason moved his popular TV variety show to Miami he wanted a barbershop quartet. The Suntones got the gig and appeared several times on Gleason's show.  Gleason loved the Suntones. Thanks to their national TV appearances made them even more popular with the public and of course increased their bookings.  To have the Suntones on your show was a coup. They were the &quot;hottest&quot; quartet in the Society.

They also appeared before millions of viewers on several nationwide broadcasts of the Orange Bowl Parade.

This national fame enabled them to also share the stage with such stars as Danny Thomas, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Mike Douglas, Louie Armstrong, Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Eddy Arnold, Kate Smith, Joe Williams, Bobby Goldsboro, President Gerald R. Ford and The Four Freshmen.  

The Suntones set themselves apart by introducing new songs into their performances such as Glen Cambell's &quot;By The Time I Get To Phoenix&quot;, Jack Jones' &quot;Lollipops and Roses&quot;, Andy Williams' &quot;Speak Softly Love&quot; and this one by David Gates and Bread.

They were also popular for their Monster Medleys.  It was their close friend Walter Latzko who created these 10-minute productions. Few quartets could have done them and Walter didn't pull any punches. They were tough.  They were also crowd pleasers.

I can remember them opening up their set standing up stage, on the top row of the empty chorus risers in a striking silhouette.  Each had individual hand held mics and stood even distances apart almost filling up the near empty stage.  The silence was broken with the opening chords of the Sound Of Music Medley. 

It was about here they would walk down stage, off the risers, the lights would come up and they would meet at the quartet position as the curtains closed behind them.  

It was truly magical

The other monster medleys were Fiddler On The Roof, My Fair Lady, and West Side Story. These medleys were and still are favorites of everyone who experienced the Suntones.

Each member of the quartet were outstanding performers in their own right, well seasoned and often appear on lists now days of &quot;My dream quartet member would be&quot;. 

Bill Cain's bass was always fun, Baritone Harlan Wilson's smooth style matched his good looks, Gene Cokeroft tenor was full voice and very distinctive and super lead Bob Franklin was all of that, just super.

In 1979 Bob decided to leave the group due to some vocal problems.  It was a shock to the barbershop world.  Most doubted another great lead could be found but then, they found him.  Drayton Justus joined the Suntones.  Drayton had won his gold medal in 1971 with the [[Gentlemen's Agreement]]. He brought with him years of experience, and great voice and this trademark song.

The Suntones never missed a beat and they continued to perform for another five years.

Their final performance was in January of '85 in Montclair, NJ during a special tribute to arranger [[Walter Latzko]]. 

Since then there have been only a handful special appearances like their 30th anniversary performance at the 1991 Sunshine District Convention.

Well, Where Are They Now?

Drayton Justice is still singing and served the Society as International President.

The great bass Bill Cain suffered from cancer and lost the battle July 31, 2004 at the age of 71.

Gene, Bob and Harlan have returned to the stage singing limited bookings with a rookie on bass, Todd Wilson.

These old friends gave us quite a thrill over the years. The Suntones showed us how it could be done professionally and raised the bar for all that followed. They were certainly ahead of their time and innovators in almost every area of quartet singing.

== Extended History ==
The '''Rapscallions''', formed just four years earlier by four Bowling Green State University students, amazed the barbershop world when they won the 1984 international quartet championship in St. Louis. 

The quartet, in fact, placed in the top ten internationally each of the three years they competed: 9th in 1982, 6th in '83, and first in 1984. 

Tenor Dave Smotzer, lead David Wallace, bari Tim Frye, and bass Jeff Oxley formed the quartet in 1980 while working summer jobs in Cedar Point, Ohio to earn money to return to Bowling Green University. 

All were members of the A Cappella Choir and the Men's Chorus at the school and had other musical training. Jeff had sung lead roles in campus productions of Man of LaMancha and The Marriage of Figaro and was studying for an operatic career. 

Graduating in 1982, most of the foursome had moved on to business careers by the time they won the gold. Both Smotzer and Wallace were insurance agents and Smotzer was directing Cincinnati's [[Southern Gateway Chorus]], while Wallace was directing Sweet Adeline's Canton City of Flags Chorus. Tim was a school teacher and music director in Wayne County, Ohio, and Jeff was continuing his musical training at the Cincinnati School of Music. He would go on to win two more gold medals ([[Acoustix]] 1990 and [[Max Q]] 2007).

== Extended History ==
The '''New Tradition''' - perhaps better known to thousands of barbershoppers as the Marx Brothers' clones - won the gold in 1985. All are experienced international competitors and medalists: tenor John Sherburn (Zeppo in their famous impersonation), lead Dan Jordan (Chico), bari Bob Gray Jr. (Harpo), and bass John Miller (Groucho). 

The quartet is in a sense a spin-off of The Grand Tradition, international bronze medalists in 1980, '82, and '83, of which Dan and Bob were members. 

John Miller had won the gold in 1979 as bass of [[Grandma's Boys]], and John Sherburn sang with the Crown City Good Time Music Co. , five time semi-finalists, and the [[Dapper Dans of Disneyland]], among other quartets. 

Although the Marx Brothers routine is their best known, the always-entertaining foursome has appeared as leading characters of Star Trek, and as Charlie Chaplin, W. C. Fields and Laurel and Hardy, and other roles. 

The quartet retired in 1989, when Sherburn replaced Larry Wright as lead of the [[BHS_International_Quartet_Medalists | 139th Street Quartet]]. Bobby Gray continues as bari of the popular and perennial top ten quartet [[BHS_International_Quartet_Medalists | Saturday Evening Post / SEP]]. Dan Jordan continues as lead of the popular show foursome, The Perfect Gentlemen. 

They STILL sing at least one show a year and are available for bookings.

Moxie Ladies is an exciting, energetic Sweet Adeline quartet that’s been WOWing audiences all over North America, and they’re delighted to have the opportunity to sing for you today.  The quartet represents two regions:  Region 4 and Region 17, and they’ve won both of those regional quartet contests.  They’ve qualified to compete at the Sweet Adelines International Competition with other quartets throughout the world for four years in a row, and in November of 2008 they were elated and honored to be named the 2009 International Quartet Champions. They are thrilled to have won their championship at the International Competition in Honolulu, Hawaii, and look forward to where their journey together as champions will lead in the future.

Their journey together began back in January, 2005 when they met for the first time with this foursome.  Jennifer and Amy, who are both music educators, began their barbershop quarteting careers in Distinction and won their first regional competition together just one year after joining the hobby!  Gretchen and Stacey, who are both in advertising sales, are second-generation barbershoppers and sang previously together in Success Express, two-time International Top Ten Quartet Finalists.

== Individual Histories ==
[[Image:Moxie5.jpg‎|right|border|300px]]

'''STACEY ST. JOHN'''
Stacey resides in Cincinnati, Ohio. While growing up in Columbus, Indiana, she began harmonizing with her father, an avid barbershopper, and knew she desperately wanted to become a Sweet Adeline. It was when she met her husband Chad, also a barbershopper, that she moved to Dayton and began her barbershopping career. Stacey has sung with several quartets, most notably, [[Success Express]], two-time International Finalists. Stacey and Chad are proud parents of two sons, Hayden and Brendan. They are also the sometimes proud owner of a bichon frise named Snoopy.


'''JENNIFER PERRY EDWARDS'''
Jennifer resides in Perrysburg, Ohio. She was introduced to barbershop while studying music at Bowling Green State University. A graduate in music, Jenn is a high school and middle school vocal music for Gibsonburg Schools. Jenn keeps busy with her 7 [[YWIH]] quartets and directing a [[Young Women in Harmony]] chorus in the her school district. She is the YWIH coordinator for Region 17 and considers young people in barbershop among her passions. She was recently named the 2008 SAI/MENC Music Educator of the Year. She plays banjo in the Chuck Taylor and the Dixie Squid Dixieland Band. Jennifer is a sought after coach and clinician.  Prior to singing with Moxie Ladies, Jenn sang lead with Region 17’s two-time regional champion quartet – [[Distinction]].  


'''AMY LEACOCK'''
Amy was introduced to barbershop when she was a student of music at Bowling Green State University and sang with her first quartet, [[Unlimited Harmony]], a college quartet. She sang jingles, which were aired nationwide, with three members of [[The Ritz]], a SPEBSQSA International Champion Quartet, and sang baritone with Jenn in [[Distinction]]. Amy is currently the assistant director of music at Upper Arlington High School. Amy recently started her own business making learning CDs for Sweet Adeline &amp; Barbershop organizations. She and husband Chris, you got it, still another barbershopper, reside in Hilliard, with their adorable and sometimes obstinate 3 year old daughter, McKenzie.


'''GRETCHEN HOLLOWAY'''
Gretchen spent her formative years wanting to sing barbershop with her mom. Her family claims a long line of both male and female barbershoppers and at the young age of 13 she and sister, Michelle, were instrumental in founding the [[Scioto Valley Chorus]], which she continues to call home. Gretchen has much experience as a quartet singer, as she and Michelle were members of [[Success Express]], Region 4’s quartet champions many years over and were two time International quartet finalists. Gretchen has her degree in American Sign Language from Columbus State Community College and currently works for Val-pak.

== Extended History ==

A spirited and fun Sweet Adelines quartet, '''Brava!''', formed in 1989 in Vancouver, BC, almost immediately became the highest-ranking Canadian quartet ever, placing in the top 10 at International 6 times, grabbing Silver in Portland, Oregon in 2001, and finally winning the coveted Gold in Phoenix in September of 2003. 

The first thing that Brava! did after being home for only 2 weeks from Phoenix was get back on a plane and fly to the U.K. where they spent 2 weeks touring Scotland, England &amp; Wales, serving as Teaching Faculty &amp; Coaches for the UK Sweet Adelines. 

In 2004, their &quot;reigning&quot; year, they appeared on many shows, including [[Masters of Harmony]] in Southern California, [[Heralds of Harmony]] in Tampa, FL, The [[Buckeye Invitational]] in Columbus, OH, [[Coastline Show Chorus]] in Providence, RI, and Pride of Portland in Oregon, to name just a few. 

They also represented Sweet Adelines International by appearing on the [[World Harmony Jamboree]] at the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]] International Convention in July of 2005 in Salt Lake City, where they saw their friends, [[Realtime]], win the world championship! 

The highlight of Brava's performance career, though, culminated with the SAI Cruise-In-A-Chord in February of 2006, which was a week-long Caribbean Cruise, sponsored by Sweet Adelines.


== Individual Histories ==
Brava! consists of 4 Canadian girls who, between them, have over 70 years of singing experience, 4 husbands, 9 children, 2 step children, 5 cats, 1 dog, and many wonderful friends, family members and coaches who fully and enthusiastically supported their journey to becoming International Champions. Besides their obvious love of singing, these four women are great friends who share a personal bond, a beautiful musical blend, and laughter that can bring down the house.

== Extended History ==

This was the second Queens of Harmony title was for lead Suzanne Harrington and bass Naima Meyer, who won with the [[Growing Girls]] quartet in 1989.


== Individual Histories ==
You'll find lead Suzanne Harrington ([[Growing Girls]], 1989) chilling out in Rönninge, Sweden with her hubby Doug ([[Second Edition]], 1989) and boys Jack and Tom. Moving to this side of the Atlantic, you'll catch bass Naima Meyer ([[Growing Girls]], 1989) on the Gulf, enjoying the warmer temperatures of sunny Florida with husband Jamie ([[Second Edition]], 1989) and kiddos Adam and Selma.  Take a short jaunt north to the rolling hills of Kentucky horse country, and there'll be tenor Eleanor Hawkins sipping a mint julep with her hub Peter, while kids Spencer, Delaney, Carter and Baby Elliot bet on the ponies.  Hop in the plane for one last trip across the continent to find baritone Patty Hawley Pennycook meandering the back roads of the California wine country with husband David and their new baby girl, Carly Jean. If you charted their individual routes to and from rehearsals, it might remind you of the map scenes in Indiana Jones!

== Extended History ==

Fanatix quartet consists of Connie Noble, tenor (past international champion with [[The 4th Edition]] and [[Savvy]] and long time tenor of [[High Society]]); Darcy Newell, lead; Sandy Shelver, baritone (past international champion with [[High Society]]); and Gerry Papageorge, bass (past international champion (tenor) with [[Panache]]). They formed in the summer of 1998 when this kid from New Mexico and a big shot tenor and baritone finally convinced another legendary tenor/lead to make bass her new mission. They earned 4th place at their first regional contest (the highest they ever got!) and earned a wild card slot to international. They were thrilled to sing their way into 4th place at their first international contest in Atlanta in 1999! (This was Darcy's first international medal, and Gerry became the first Sweet Adeline ever to earn international medals in 3 different voice parts: lead, tenor, and bass).

In 2001, they teamed up with coaches, Jean Barford, Nick Papageorge, and Lynne Smith and really got to work on finding their sound. It was an exciting realization of that good hard work to be crowned international champs in Portland on October 12, 2001. 


== Individual Histories ==

Connie is a buyer/planner for Qualcomm, Inc. in San Diego and enjoys golfing, shopping, creating dried florals, and collecting antique china. Darcy is an executive producer of TV commercials for a production company based in Santa Monica and recently became a licensed insurance and securities agent in California. She enjoys playing outside. Sandy is a travel agent in San Diego and a world traveler; she greatly enjoys being the grandmother of two!Ê Gerry is the mother of 3 boys, a voice teacher, and has a holiday decorating business; she presently enjoys the thought of some day completing her newly re-designed home in La Habra, California.

U4X was crowned as Harmony Queens in 2008 at the 49th Anniversary International Contest and Convention in Appleton, Wisconsin. They began competing in 2008, and won the quartet championship the same year. Lynn, Jeanne and Lauren are members of award-winning [[Village Vocal Chords]] from LaGrange, Illinois, and Katie Taylor is a member of the award-winning [http://northernblendchorus.homestead.com Northern Blend] chorus from Watertown, New York.

== Individual Histories ==

'''Katie Taylor (tenor)''' Music Educator, Chorus Medalist and Quartet Champion

Katie Taylor is a professional music educator in upstate NY, and is a two-time gold medalist with Harmony, Inc. Quartet Champions U4X (2008) and For Heaven's Sake (1996). She also co-directs Northern Blend Chorus, international medalists, becoming a co-director with her mother in April of 2003. The chorus is thrilled to be on the receiving end of the vast wealth of musical knowledge and talents that Katie has to offer. Her talents are surpassed, if only slightly, by the way she teaches her craft and her zestful personality.

Katie is a Kindergarten to grade 12 vocal music teacher and also directs the annual musicals at her school. In 2007 she was awarded Music Teacher of the Year by the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra after being nominated by her principal, peers and students, both past and present. Katie also received the Kay DeLong Award at Harmony, Inc. Area 3's Area Contest And Convention in 2008 for her service to her chapter, her area, and to Harmony, Inc. as a whole. Katie also acts as youth coordinator for Area 3 and loves to work with young ladies who may become members of our organization in the future.

In 2008, Katie competed in her new quartet, U4X, on the international stage and took her second gold, only this time as tenor instead of bass. She continues to sing with both For Heaven's Sake and U4X and is thrilled to once again be representing Harmony, Inc. as reigning queens.

Katie loves to coach quartets and choruses in both Harmony, Inc. and the Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS). She also makes learning tracks (see URL: www.TaylorTrax.homestead.com) that she happily uses to help quartets and choruses learn their new music. 


'''Lynn Randall (lead)''' Singing Category Director/Singing Judge, Chorus Medalist and Quartet Champion

Lynn started her barbershop career with the Sweet Adelines organization in 1974. She sang with the North River Chapter and sang lead in The Shipmates quartet. The quartet was very active and placed third at Regional Competitions. A member of Harmony, Inc. since 1980, Lynn has spent the last 30 years working with people to help them discover their voice, to not fear the unknown and to try everything.

Lynn is a voice and performance coach and sings lead with the Village Vocal Chords Chapter of Harmony, Inc. 17-time International Gold Medalists. Lynn also sings lead in U4X, the 2008 International gold-medalist quartet champions. Lynn also has sung lead with Voices, the 2002 International gold-medalist quartet champions, Talk of the Town, the 1988 International gold-medalist quartet champions and for 14 years she sang lead with The Villagers, the 1977 International Quartet champions. The Villagers retired in November of 1996 after singing together for 32 years. Lynn serves on the music team and is the lead section leader for the Village Vocal Chords.

Lynn directed the Harmonettes chorus of Harmony, Inc. from 1986 to 1992, placing in the medals five out of six years. She has also served as Harmony Inc.'s education chairman for ten years, developing their present certification program. As a certified singing judge and the current-singing category director, Lynn has coached choruses and quartets throughout the world.

When not at home playing with their dogs or singing, Lynn and fellow quartet member Lauren Lindeman run a business called &quot;The Music Team&quot; that concentrates its efforts on teaching the art of vocal music through performance.


'''Lauren Lindeman (baritone)''' Music judge, chorus medalist and quartet champion  

Lauren started her barbershop career with a small chorus in her college town in 1970. After graduating from university in 1972, she moved back home and one year later founded the Village Vocal Chords of Harmony, Inc. in July of 1973.

It took only a few months for her to begin singing baritone in a quartet and by 1977, she won a quartet championship with The Villagers. Since then, she has won 17 gold medals with her chorus, the Village Vocal Chords, and 2 more quartet gold medals, with Voices in 2002 and U4X in 2008.

Lauren joined Harmony, Inc.'s judging program at its inception, serving on the committee that started the program in 1977. In 1984 she was certified in the sound category in the first group of Harmony, Inc. judges. In 1992 when the BHS changed its judging categories, she went from the sound category to the new music category, and served as the music category director for 10 years. Lauren remains in the music category and has served on panels for Ladies Association of British Barbershop Singers (LABBS) and for BHS in recent years.

Lauren is an experienced chorus and quartet coach who has worked with many of Harmony, Inc.'s medalist choruses and quartets.   


'''Jeanne O'Connor (bass)''' Past Chairman of Judges, Presentation Judge, chorus medalist and quartet champion

Jeanne O'Connor lives in Chicago, Illinois. She began singing barbershop as a teenager and has been a member of Harmony, Inc. for over 45 years.  She has sung with two other championship quartets, [[Scale Blazers]] (1964), [[Esprit de Corps]] (1974), as well as being the replacement bass for the 1987 quartet champions, [[Kaleidoscope]] and 2002 quartet champions, [[Voices]]. Jeanne is an accomplished barbershop educator, has served on the Harmony, Inc. International Board of Directors (including serving as International President), is a certified Chairman of Judges and is a certified Presentation Judge.  She is currently the director of the 17-time international chorus champion [[Village Vocal Chords]].

== Extended History ==

This was the first time the quartet competed together on the International level. This was not the first International gold medal for any of the quartet members. In 1985 baritone Karen Breidert won the gold with [[Jubilation]]. In 1992 bass Jeannie Froelich and tenor Nancy Fuhrmann sang together in [[City Lights]] and brought home their first gold medal. In 1994 lead Debbie Connelly and her then quartet [[Showtime]] were crowned champions. This dynamic foursome came together in January 2003 and became “the BUZZ” and have been creating just that ever since. Competing together for the first time in April of 2004, then becoming International champions a mere six months later!

They have a combined age of 93 and come together with varying degrees of barbershop experience, from having never sung in a quartet before to having sung several times on the International Stage.

The quartet consists of two American members and two Canadian members. Samantha Swanson and Julia Borsari are members of [[New England Voices in Harmony]], from Nashua, New Hampshire, while Lindsay Chartier and Jennifer Wheaton are members of [[Montreal City Voices]], from Montreal, Quebec.

==Member Biographies==
====Samantha Swanson====
Samantha Swanson (20) has been singing barbershop since the age of 10, and was a founding member of [[Harmony, Inc.]] chorus [[New England Voices in Harmony]]. She is currently singing with [[St. Louis Harmony Chorus]], with [[Sweet Adelines International]]. From Nashua, NH, she is a junior at Washington University in St. Louis, working towards a Bachelor of Music in Music History. Samantha is a member of the university's Concert Choir, a staff singer in the choir of the Church of St. Michael and St. George, and sings in Ficta, a voice/lute duet that performs music of the Renaissance.  Outside of barbershop, her passion is early music (music of the medieval and Renaissance periods), and she plans to get a masters degree in early music vocal performance.

Ask anyone in Ringtones!...Sam is VERY blonde, never stops singing to herself, and has a habit of spazzing about beautiful chords!

====Jennifer Wheaton====
Jennifer Wheaton (24) is from St. Hubert, Quebec. Jen grew up in the barbershop world, and has been a member of [[Montreal City Voices]] since April of 1998. She is the assistant director of the chorus, and has competed with them on both the Area and International Stages. Besides Ringtones!, Jen has competed with two other quartets, Under the Wire (2002) and 4 The Fun Of It (2004-2005). Jen loves singing in quartets. So much so that she also has a long-distance [[Young Women In Harmony]] (SAI) quartet, The Brats. 

Jen is very passionate about music and language. She is currently a Linguistics major at Concordia University, in Montreal. She plans to do a Masters in Speech and Language Pathology, but not sure, yet where. She just finished an international exchange semester at University of Connecticut, and is looking forward to her next semester at University of New Hampshire.

One of Jen’s other passions is nature. She is an amateur nature photographer, and has had a couple of her photos published.

====Julia Borsari====
Julia Borsari, 21, sang her first note in a barbershop chord at the age of 4, while watching the Mitch Miller PBS special featuring [[Acoustix]]. She sang the baritone note, and has been singing baritone ever since! 

Julia was raised around barbershop. Her grandfather, Jim Dodge, her aunt, Wendy McCoole, and her mom, Debbie Borsari, have been actively involved in the hobby for Julia's entire life. She joined [[New England Voices in Harmony]], based in Nashua, NH, when she was only 11 and was also a member of her middle school chorus, her high school chorus, the Select Chorus, and was selected to participate in the New England Music Festival while in high school. Julia is thrilled to be singing in her very first quartet, Ringtones! 

Julia is currently a senior at Kent State University in Ohio studying Fashion Merchandising. She is a member of the Kent Women's Chorus and the Kent Community Chorus, and is hoping to become involved in barbershop singing at the school. Her home is in Peterborough, NH where she lives (when not at school) with her mom, dad, and 17-year-old brother, Joe.

====Lindsay Chartier====
Lindsay Chartier, 32, is from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Lindsay's involvement in barbershop singing began in 1994 when she sang lead with a mixed youth quartet, The Mixed Nuts, and since then she has been loving every minute of it! 

She is a dual member of Harmony, Inc. and Sweet Adelines International and has quartetting experience in both organizations. She is also an Associate of the Barbershop Harmony Society. 

She has called Montreal City Voices home since August 1996, and in December 2004 became their front line director. 

When she is not singing or directing, Lindsay actively coaches choruses and quartets and has taught classes at Area 2 Conventions and Education Days. 

Lindsay has her decree from Dawson College in Community Recreation Leadership Training and is currently employed as an Administrative Assistant  in the Donations &amp; Development Departement at the Shriners Hospitals for Children - Canada.

On July 30, 2011, Lindsay married Mark Holdeman of Dallas, Texas. It was their passion of barbershop music that brought them together.  It is their love and passion for life that promises a lifetime of happiness and beautiful music making.

== Extended History ==
These four sisters grew up singing together and in 1939 entered their first barbershop contest - a men's contest in Chicago. They became famous in barbershopping circles, performing extensively, and were the first women's quartet to release a record album, just prior to their retirement in 1950. The Johnson Sisters placed second at the 1947 Sweet Adeline convention; they went home to Chicago and founded the Chicago #1 Chapter of Sweet Adelines. The quartet was named national champions at the second Sweet Adelines convention and competition in Topeka, Kansas, 1948. Their winning songs were ''Mandy and Me'' and ''Apple Blossom Time in Normandy''.

== The Group ==
If you like to laugh, this is your group. Chordiac Arrest got the judges laughing so hard they let the quartet slip into the top ten in their [[BHS Intl Quartet Contest 1987 | first International contest]]. It was five years before the judges stopped laughing long enough to realize what they had done. By that time, Chordiac had made the Top Ten three more times and were wearing [[BHS International Quartet Medalists | two International medals]].

&quot;Live and Well&quot; contains a full half-hour show, complete with between-songs gags and patter, plus seven other goodies. &quot;Second Opinion&quot; has 14 more tunes from contest and show stage. (No, they don't do anything straight.) The famous Chordiac Arrest guarantee: If you don't laugh harder every time you hear it, we'll cheerfully consider a full refund.

== Extended History ==
From Santa Fe Springs, Rincon Beach, and Westminster, CA.  

Metropolis has performed over 450 stage shows in the United States and 8 other countries (Finland, Russia, England, Canada, New Zealand, The Netherlands, Japan and Ireland) and has traveled to more than 160 cities in 38 different states in the USA.

Metropolis came to the attention of national television audiences early in their career, beginning with their appearance on [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcR2emhT2HU &quot;What's Your Hobby&quot;], followed by the pilot episode of the [http://www.vancedegeneres.com/pages/tv/4thfloor.htm &quot;Fourth Floor Show&quot;] on E! Entertainment Television with Vance DeGeneres and the filming of a national Dr Pepper commercial. They have also appeared on Diagnosis: Murder in which Dick Van Dyke sang a song with the quartet in the episode entitled [http://www.tv.com/diagnosis-murder/santa-claude/episode/15930/summary.html &quot;Santa Claude&quot;]. Metropolis has made several radio appearances and also performed in an independent film entitled [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281024/ &quot;Pacino is Missing&quot;].

Each member of the quartet has served as section leader for their respective part as part of International Barbershop Chorus Champion [[Masters of Harmony]] and were part of the history-making performances in Salt Lake City in 1996 and Anaheim in 1999 which garnered the Masters their third and fourth consecutive International Chorus Championships. The quartet was also named the [[Masters of Harmony]] 1996 Quartet of the Year.

In addition to becoming 1996-97 Far Western District Champions, on May 9, 1998, Metropolis earned the Harmony Sweepstakes' Grand National A Cappella Championship - the first barbershop quartet to do so in the history of the event - and in 1999, the [http://www.casa.org/ Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards] (or CARAs) nominated Metropolis' CD [http://www.harmonize.com/metropolis/metrocds.htm &quot;Aural Hygiene&quot;] for &quot;Best Barbershop Recording&quot; and &quot;Best Barbershop Song&quot;.

The quartet has performed an average of 23 shows per year for over 12 years and continues to perform around the United States as well as traveling to Europe, Asia, Russia and the Pacific Rim to teach and perform.  In 2011, they came out of retirement for a &quot;one-time show&quot; for a local Sweet Adelines International chapter, at the behest of their friend, Caroline McLean (who also directed Brian Philbin's sister-in-law in the chorus).  Shortly after announcement of the performance, the quartet was again inundated with show requests and has resumed (for the time being)  [http://www.harmonize.com/metropolis/metrogig.htm a healthy show schedule for 2012].

The quartet also prides themselves on having [http://www.harmonize.com/metropolis The Official &quot;the most fun and interactive website in all barbershop-dom&quot;].

They competed once in 1994 with Ken Potter on tenor, placing 25th.

3 years later, they came back with James Sabina on tenor.  They were semi-finalists for three years, and then in 2000 they cracked the top ten.  They earned their first medal in 2002, placing 5th.

They medaled three times, rising as high as 3rd in 2003 and then baritone Mike McGee moved to Florida.  They competed with Mike once more in 2004, placing 4th when he elected to leave the quartet and was replaced by Kelly Shepard, who won two more medals (3rd in 2005 and 4th in 2006) with the quartet.  They took a year off in 2007 and came back in 2008, coming out just ahead of [[Crossroads]] at Prelims in the Pioneer District (this was [[Crossroads]]' first prelims appearance), then placed 8th at International that year.  

To honor the overseas barbershop organizations that helped propel the quartet's following, Metropolis returned to International to sing their Swan Song during the 2009 World Harmony Jamboree, not only reuniting Mike McGee with the quartet for a few songs, but also including both he and Kelly Shepard for their final performance of &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;, their signature finale.

== Extended History ==
The 139th Quartet, although never winning gold, were among the most popular and influential quartets in [[Barbershop Harmony Society]] history.  Winning 8 medals, they were a constant fixture at International contests, with a repertoire of catchy Tin Pan Alley and 1920s tunes that often challenged the contest rules of the time.  

To some, they are more famous for the lore surrounding an International contest they missed rather than the many in which they participated.  After placing 2nd in 1977, they were contacted the following spring by someone who was scheduled to be an Arrangement Judge at the 1978 contest.  He indicated to them that if they sang one of their famous songs, &quot;Don't Put a Tax On The Beautiful Girls,&quot; they would be penalized and/or disqualified for singing the altered melody, as it was not allowed at the time.  The quartet decided to boycott the upcoming contest.

After discussion with then Arrangement Category Specialist, [[Ed Waesche]], it was determined that the song was allowable and the threatening judge was informed of that fact.  The quartet was prepared to return to contest, but lead Jimmy Meehan was still upset that a judge would make such a threat.  The rest of the quartet decided they wanted to compete, and told him that he was outvoted.  In response, he quit the quartet.  They missed the 1978 contest, brought newly relocated Larry Wright into the fold, and the rest is history.

The quartet was very influential in many other facets of the hobby we enjoy today:
*  They encouraged the early growth of many affiliates, traveling to SNOBS and BABS regularly.
*  They encouraged barbershop in Russia, bringing [[The Quiet Don Quartet]] to the San Francisco convention in 1990.
*  Peter Neushul and Jim Kline were the founders of the Collegiate Quartet Contest in 1992.
*  The appeared often on TV:  Night Court, Nurses, 2 episodes of Cheers, and others
*  They own two Platinum Records as back-up singers for 2 of Neil Diamond's Christmas Albums

The 15-year gap between their first and last medal remains a record, including a 13-year gap between silvers.  Oddly enough, Jim Kline would win another silver with [[Gotcha!]] in 2003, 13 years after 139th Street's last silver.

== Extended History ==
The Air Fours had formed in 1953 as an entry in the Air Force [http://www.topsinblue.com/page320029.html Worldwide Talent Contest], starting at a base-level contest held at their base's Service Club, eventually heading to the Air Force-level competition and winning the first place trophy (called “Roger”) at the 10-day competition.

From summer 1954 to March 1955, the Air Fours were one of twelve acts (totaling 24 Air Force servicemen and -women) of the [http://www.topsinblue.com/history.html Tops in Blue], an Air Force entertainment group that toured military bases worldwide. Comedian [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Van_Dyke Jerry Van Dyke], an air force serviceman at the time, was one of the 24 entertainers touring with the Tops in Blue that same year. As part of the Tops in Blue, the Air Fours appeared on Ed Sullivan's television show, [http://www.edsullivan.com/sofa-entertainment &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;], recorded at Mitchel Air Field in Long Island, New York in July, 1954, during the Tops tour of US-based installations, prior to their departure in December for the Arctic, Europe, the Azores and North Africa with the Northeast Air Command.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1387">[[Image:DapperDans-Disney.jpg|thumb|300px|The Dapper Dans at the Magic Kingdom, 2006]]

'''The Dapper Dans''' are a barbershop quartet that performs at Disneyland in Anaheim, California (since 1959), at the Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort (since 1971), and at Hong Kong Disneyland in Lantau Island, Hong Kong (since 2005). The Dans were tested at Disneyland Paris, but were cut due to cost management.


== Details ==

While the group usually performs as a quartet, they actually have up to twelve singers at each park, plus occasional substitutes. This allows them to have multiple quartets performing separately or to combine and form a larger ensemble. Membership has changed over the years as various singers have retired or died and new ones have been brought in to succeed them. Several of the Dapper Dans are members of the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]].


The Dapper Dans perform nine sets a day, seven days a week. They can be found on the horse-drawn trolley in the morning, and all over Main Street USA during the afternoon. At 5pm, the Dans join the Main Street Philharmonic and the Magic Kingdom Security Color Guard for the Flag Retreat Ceremony.

== About ==
The Zamboni Brothers are made up of 4 long-time friends, including a set of real brothers. They formed in
August of 2004 and won the [[DIX Quartet Champions|Dixie District Quartet Champions]] that fall! All four are members of The [[Atlanta Vocal Project]] ('05, '08, '11 Dixie District Chorus Champs).

'''Allen Reynolds (tenor)''' has been barbershopping since 1988 and can hold a loud, high note for a very long time. He has spent the last 20 years of his life as an aerospace engineer for NASA in Huntsville, AL. He has an idea for a solar powered flashlight he hopes will soon take off. Upon finally learning that barbershop competition is not exactly rocket science Allen immediately won his first Dixie District Quartet Championship in 2004 with Zamboni Brothers. He lives in Huntsville, AL with his wife Tamra, a Sweet Adeline, and his motocross-racing son, Jamison.
 
'''Tim Reynolds (lead)''' A society member since 1989, he is a 3-time Dixie District Quartet Champ (Bandstand '96, [[Riptide]] '98, Zamboni Brothers '04) and is a 5-time past international medalist with [[Riptide]] from 2001-2005
and lead of the Int'l Top 10 quartet, [[Glory Days]] ('06-'09). Tim, and his talented Sweet Adeline wife Amy, are the proud parents of triplet boys, Owen, Braden, and Stephen. But their youngest, daughter Meagan, keeps the triplets walking the straight and narrow. Tim is currently working as a Chief IT Engineer and lives in Cumming, GA.

'''Brad Hine (baritone)''' A society member since 1983, Brad sang his first tag in diapers as he is a 3rd gen barbershopper. He has been a member of many Dixie quartets over the last 20 years: [[Uptown Sound]], The Bungee Chords, Scruffy Murphys, The Polecat Daddies, them and Zamboni Brothers. He is Product Manager for ETI Software in Norcross, GA and is married to Georgia Hine, a regional champ quartet singer and member of [[Song of Atlanta]] Show Chorus. They live in Alpharetta, GA with their 3-year old son, Kelso.

'''Brian Williams (bass)''' A society member since 1989, Brian first sang barbershop in high school in Tulsa, OK. Upon graduating college he married his high school sweetheart, Brenda and they settled in Marietta, GA in 1992. Brian is 3-time Dixie District Quartet Champ (Atlanta Power Company '93, Bandstand '96, Zamboni Brothers '04). By day, Brian is a computer programmer for Hitachi Data Systems and by night he is a Dad to his two children, Shannon (16) and Reed (14). Brian is also a pilot in his spare time and takes every chance to roam the wild blue yonder.

== Biography ==
'''After Hours'''

After Hours Barbershop Quartet, based in Central Illinois, started singing together in 2009. Since then, they have had the pleasure of singing in a variety of venues across the midwest. They have also enjoyed coaching from several distinguished barbershoppers, including Terry Ludwig, director of the Sound of Illinois Chorus, [[Kevin Keller]], an influential arranger and BHS judge, and [[Eric Dalbey]] and [[Tim Waurick]] of [[Vocal Spectrum]], the 2006 International Barbershop Quartet Champions. 

After Hours began competing in the spring of 2009 and have since become the 2010 [[Illinois District]] quartet champions as well as the three-time Illinois District collegiate champions (2009-2011). At the 2011 International Barbershop Convention, After Hours competed in the Quartet Competition, and made it to the semifinal round where they placed 16th overall. Additionally, they placed 3rd in the Collegiate Quartet Competition, scoring higher than any previous Illinois District collegiate quartet competing at the international level.

[[File:DSC 0397 FB Cover.JPG|right|400px]]

== About ==

Formed in early 2013, they rapidly grew as a top-end performing group and qualified for the annual international barbershop quartet contest where they placed 23rd. This foursome may be a new combination, but their members have been accomplished international barbershop performers for many years. Founded on the belief that music is about sharing. This quartet formed to embark on a journey together.

Entertaining audiences through genuine and honest delivery of music is the goal of this foursome. From love ballads, inspirational music, traditional barbershop, and feature selections we hope you will enjoy their unique blend and artistry that makes them one of the top performing groups in the barbershop harmony society.

Represented [[Area 4]].


== Recordings ==



== Extended History ==

Spot On is a new up-and-coming quartet from Harmony, Incorporated out of Area 4. They formed in February of 2013 and competed in their first Area competition in June where they were honored to place first. In November they competed in the Harmony, Incorporated International Quartet CONTEST, and were delightfully surprised and deeply humbled to be crowned the 2013 Harmony Queens!

Maggie, Jen, Joy and Kris come from different parts of the country, so rehearsals are always a treat. Hailing from Indianapolis, Indiana, Chicago, Illinois, St. Louis, Missouri and Louisville, Kentucky respectively, the girls really enjoy getting together for shows, contests and rehearsals to spend time together... and maybe even sing a little.

Spot On is a very family oriented quartet, as all of its members are &quot;Barbershop Brats.&quot; Any success the quartet has had, can all be traced back to their loving and supportive families. Learn more about our families on the &quot;Our Barbershop Origins&quot; tab.

== Individual Histories ==

All four members of Spot On are at least second-generation barbershoppers. Baritone Joy is a third, while bass Kris is a fourth.

Maggie is the second-youngest ever (by three weeks) to win the Harmony, Inc. quartet championship.  The title is held by multiple-time international champion and international president Jeanne O'Connor.

== Extended History ==
'''Boston Consort'''

Something of a Northeastern District supergroup quartet, Boston Consort evolved from the original Boston Common lineup following Rich Knapp’s departure from active performance with the quartet in the wake of a serious 1982 car accident that left him hearing impaired. Initially, Boston Common replaced Knapp with Tommy Spirito (a hero of Knapp’s and a well-established International-level quartet lead from the NED) for a handful of studio recordings and limited live engagements. Kent Martin eventually also took a hiatus from active performance with the group, leaving the tenor slot open and only half of the original quartet members remaining.

Stand-in tenors included Eddie Ryan of [[Easternaires]] fame as they continued to perform on sparse occasions as Boston Common until a stable lineup fell into place with Fran Page on tenor. The foursome then decided to rebrand themselves as Boston Consort, a name that paid tribute to their origins while acknowledging the new personnel. Featuring four of the winningest competitive quartet singers ever to hail from the Northeastern District, Boston Consort delighted audiences with their unique sound. Their legacy lives on especially with the popularity of the particular arrangement of “Sittin’ On Top of the World” that [[Second Edition]] famously included on their self-titled studio album, a chart that Boston Consort originally woodshedded from scratch. The chart, as originally woodshedded and as still often performed today, is now available in print via the Society’s Harmony Marketplace with the entire quartet credited as its arrangers.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://shop.barbershop.org/sheet-music/published/im-sitting-on-top-of-the-world/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quartet Members ==
*Tenor: Martijn Hoeksema
*Lead: Peter van Hamersveld
*Bass: Martin Havinga
*Baritone: Patrick Bergers

== History ==
The quartet members were already singing together for years in nine time Dutch champion chorus [[Whale City Sound]]. After singing together in afterglows and getting to know each other more and more they had the feeling that this was ''&quot;meant to be&quot;''.

''Unique, Fresh, Energetic, Emotions and Fun'' is what Men2B stands for. With loads of energy and fun they want to entertain the audience and give them a special moment.

A [[Barbershop Harmony Society]] quartet from Atlanta, GA, they attempt to re-create songs that combine great barbershop harmony with folk music and some instrumentation. The inspiration... music and fashion of the 1920's. Boardwalk preserves the music sung by such great quartets as Midnight Oilers, [[The Suntones]], [[Easternaires]], The [[Mid States Four]], [[Boston Common]], and The [[Roaring '20s]].

[[Image:GaylordQuartet circa1950.jpg|thumb|Gaylord Quartet, circa 1950]]

The '''Gaylord Quartet''' was active in the 1940s and 1950s in Toledo, OH.

The only member identified in the photo here is Marvin Stimpfle (lower center). Albert Gause is likely another member shown. The photo is from about the same time as the 1951 BHS (then [[SPEBSQSA]]) [[BHS Intl Quartet Contest 1951|International Quartet Contest]] which was held in Toledo that year. It is unknown if they competed in the competition.

Marvin passed in 1971 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ivFOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0AEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4482%2C1379492], and Albert in 1995 [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=74255670].

*Marv sang as one of the [[Channel Markers]], a quartet formed by Walter Schwartz, who revised &quot;Toledo, Our Future's Terrific&quot; to make it nautical themed. In 1957, the quartet (also including Carl Murphy and George Yeats) recorded the song, called &quot;The Port Song&quot;.

'''The Jazz Firm''' were the [[LABBS Quartet Champions]] in 2003. Their first competition was LABBS Convention 2001, where they won the silver medal.  After a change in line up and a year during which they chose not to compete, they placed fourth at the European Convention in The Netherlands in March 2003. At the 2003 LABBS Convention, they won the gold medal and the three category trophies for singing, presentation and music.

During their gold medal year they represented LABBS at the Buckeye Invitational Competition in Columbus, Ohio in August 2005, where they were placed third.  They also placed second at an international convention hosted by LABBS in Cardiff in October 2005.
