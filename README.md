Tools for processing the barbershopwiki.com singers and quartet information.

Running the script:
* Go to http://www.barbershopwiki.com/wiki/Special:Export
* Download all pages of the "Quartets" category and save the file as Barbershop+Wiki+Project-quartets.xml
* Download all pages of the "List of Champions" category and save the file as Barbershop+Wiki+Project-listofchampions.xml
* Execute bsWikiQuartetParser.py
* Check the newly generated *.txt files for resultant data.


I welcome suggestions and feedback, and plan to add information on the structure of the captured data in future efforts,
as well as add fuzzy searches to identify people whose names have been printed in different variations.
